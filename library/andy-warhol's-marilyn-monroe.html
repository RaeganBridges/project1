                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe is an iconic piece of American pop art. it's an instantly recognizable image with a very important place in art history. It's a smart choice for inclusion in the first wave of LEGO® Art mosaic sets. Aimed at adults, the LEGO® Art theme debuted in September of 2020 with four sets. The mosaics are an interesting, mature-focused product that I think will appeal to some younger builders as well. This is my first set of this kind and it happens to coincide on the one year mark of the product's debut. I also chose Marilyn because of the great bold colours that fit right in with my home decor. With that in mind, let's have a look at this vibrant and actually very fun theme one year on.</p>
                <p>It's a total win from a cost perspective, but like all things, it depends how you look at it. The vast majority of the pieces are flat, 1x1 round tiles. Bricks and plates make up the rest, with the biggest piece being one of nine 16x16 technic base squares.</p>
                <p>The build goes very smoothly if you set up properly. This is a paint-by-numbers style approach to building. And creating a mosaic doesnt allow much room for error. A tile off here or there would look pretty glaring. All the colours are assigned a number and should be separated into bowls, trays, etc. Then it's a simple matter of following along line by line and putting down the right amount of tiles. A nice trick is to put a ruler under each line to not get too confused. Each 16x16 square is done in order from top to bottom. It's very easy to follow along and each grid is given a full page to reference.</p>
                <p>This is not a complicated build. But it is a very soothing one. If you've ever done an "Adult Colouring Book" or something similar, you know there's some nice relaxing energy to just playing with colours. I also appreciate that it's a completely different build experience. There's repetition for sure, but It's not a grueling process that takes hours, nor is it over in a flash. Given the smaller colour palette to work with, this is probably one of the more straight forward and faster builds for the theme. It's a great time from start to finish and the set gets a great score of 95%.</p>
                <p>At first glance it might be difficult to see the entertainment value in a set like this. In particular any repeat or long-lasting value. But I have to say this was a very enjoyable experience. This is in equal parts thanks to the build and the recommended "soundtrack" custom-made for this set. Each of the LEGO® Art sets has an accompanying audio featurette that you can access through the LEGO® YouTube account.</p>
                <p>The soundtrack is less a collection of music and more a series of talking points and interviews. In this case we get to hear from some current modern artists, a Warhol biographer, the curator of the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and the set's designers. Overall it's a really deep dive into the artist and his art. Much more time is spent on Warhol compared to the set itself. And that is definitely the right call as you learn quite a lot. The designers come in towards the end with some great insights on the set/theme's development. It's all great stuff. The soundtrack clocks in at roughly 98 minutes. This covered me for about 3/5 of my building time with Beethoven helping out for the last bit. It's definitely a "one-and-done" experience, but it's a great value-add for this theme.</p>
                <p>Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe helps you build a static image with ease. The real creativity and entertainment for these LEGO® Art sets comes from being able to choose from either 3 or 4 images. Although there are a number of extra pieces included, you can't simply make another. But you certainly can buy another three sets to create the full range of 4 images. That's a costly and tall order and when I first heard of this I did balk at the idea. But now that I have one, it just seems silly to stop there. I think I'm hooked folks. The other colours are also great and have such a lovely vibrant palette.</p>
                <p>The build is great, the audio soundtrack is very well done and the end result looks fantastic on the wall. I originally assumed these sets would have limited appeal, but I have been happily corrected. They're a great adult-focused product but I see no reason why a younger builder can't find the appeal as well.</p>
