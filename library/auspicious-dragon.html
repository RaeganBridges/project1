                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>In Chinese culture, dragons are supernatural creatures which symbolize power, intelligence, confidence and prosperity, which is why they're right at the top of the Chinese Zodiac Animal hierarchy. 2024 is the year of the Wood Dragon (which might explain the pine-y color of this dragon), and fun fact, in China and countries with large population of Chinese diaspora, you often find a huge spike of births as parents try to have “dragon babies” as there's the belief that kids born in the year will inherit all those positive traits assigned to dragons.</p>
                <p>No stickers are included in the set which is always a welcome discovery upon opening the box. There are 2 printed elements (as well as the dragon eyes), one on a window panel, and dragon scales printed on tan Nexo Knights shields as decorated elements. The build was really fun - there are 10 plastic bags included in the set, but the build goes by pretty quickly. You begin by constructing the base, before starting on the dragon, and coming back to the base to finish it off with a few little details. The printed plaque has a phrase printed on it that loosely translates to “An Auspicious Dragon brings forth prosperity”.</p>
                <p.>It exudes tremendous display presence and boasts a really eye-catching color palette, which features tan, with hints of yellow, orange, red and pops of teal throughout, helping its visual fidelity but also giving off a fantastical fantasy vibe. A standout design feature is the sense of motion captured by the dragon. The cloud streaking by on the rock, waves and agitation on the water, and the Auspicious Dragon's curved body and raised hand all contribute to a striking and awesome pose. The build also features some well-considered techniques, especially in the dragon's head. It's very subtle, but the selection of elements, and techniques used to give it an organic shape are incredibly masterful.

                <p>LEGO's Spring Festival theme continues to deliver in 2024, and 80112 Auspicious Dragon is a brilliant addition to the theme with an exceptional display model that has broad appeal, beyond those that celebrate or observe the Lunar New Year. This is LEGO creature building at its finest, with an interesting silhouette, plenty of great techniques employed and most of all, translates the look of a Chinese Dragon flawlessly into LEGO form. The stand and the dragon's in-motion pose create plenty of display value and will not look out of place if you like displaying Oriental or Chinese-themed objects in your home or workspace. The price also makes for a great set to dip your toes into the theme, and even if you ignore the cultural significance of the set, you can still enjoy one of the most eye-catching and beautiful LEGO display models at this price bracket.</p>
