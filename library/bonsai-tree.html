                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>This is one of the nicest looking boxarts I've seen within the 18+ type sets. The tan greebling strip looks great alongside the green glow behind the set. It's very appropriate for this set, and gives it a classy feel. You get a single instruction manual with it. The manual only has a picture of the set on the front and is completely plain black otherwise. Its also a fair bit smaller than I expected. The instructions come with a little UCS-style intro at the beginning with some information about the set and real life bonsai trees. There isn't a lot to read, but it does add a premium feel to the set and the extra info is welcome. It mentions how 3 of the elements in the set are made from a plastic derived from sugarcane, which makes it much more sustainable. This isn't the first time this plastic has been used in a LEGO set, but it is a very appropriate subtheme to trial it more regularly. There were 6 numbered bags in the set. One for the black base, one for the trunk, another for the pebbles, one for the green and pink configurations respectively, and finally one for the wooden base.</p>
                <p>Sorting and knolling the pieces was super easy and barely took any time at all. The numbered bags contained pretty similar pieces throughout so it probably only took 10ish minutes to organise then it was straight building. I found the first half of the build really fun. It starts off with the black base, which came together quickly with lots of tiling off to make it smooth. The trunk was a quick yet somewhat complex build. I loved the techniques used to get the angle of the tree and to thicken the spine. Bag three was a fairly unique step that somewhat resembled the step in the Ship in a Bottle set, where you dump a bag full of 1x1 circular tiles into the set. The difference being that the instructions tell you to mix it around in the plastic bag first (presumably so there is a more random distribution of pebbles in the base) before dumping them in. I don't know why they bagged half the pebbles separately though, as it would've ended up "randomized" anyway had they just had one bag with all pebble colours in it from the start. This was still a really fun step though, despite the slightly wasteful use of plastic bags.</p>
                <p>After bag three though, the build took a tedious turn. It's at this point that you begin to assemble the actual leaves and branches of the tree. You first build the green version of the tree, before proceeding with the alternate pink one. The green version was tolerable, probably because its your first time putting together the leaves, and the experience is fresh and new. There is a fair amount of repetition with it, but not as much as you might think just by looking at it. Towards the end of the green section, I just gave up trying to follow the instructions perfectly and just placed the leaves where I think made sense.</p>
                <p>The pink version of the tree, on the other hand, was a pain. It was super tedious, especially having just finished the green version, and there was a lot more repetition involved (at least it certainly felt like there was). It felt like you were just doing the same thing 20+ times, which was just exhausting. I couldn't wait to be finished with this section as I was building it. It needed to be this way, of course. You can't recreate the natural look of the Bonsai Tree without some repetition. My advice is, if you do get this set, only build the version you want to display and keep the alternate pieces somewhere safe. Should a time come where you want to see how the other version looks, build it then. This should save you from the tedium.</p>
                <p>The wooden base at the end was a very simple build. There was nothing surprising or noteworthy about it really. You can almost piece it together yourself just by looking at pictures, honestly. There was a good degree of tiling involved, as you can imagine, which is always fairly satisfying to do. Overall, I'd describe the build as varied, as you get an interesting mix of simple, complex, and generally unique steps with this set.</p>
                <p>The design of this thing is absolutely beautiful and perfectly captures the essence of a bonsai tree. It has a small footprint, and its natural colours don't pop out at you and demand your focus (in the green version at least). It's a very nice set to just leave on your desk, whether at home or at work. My favourite part of the build was definitely the trunk. Its really well textured and the designer created an incredibly natural shape for the tree. The two vine pieces that wrap around the trunk is such a small addition but it adds so much to the look of the set. The pebbles at the base mask the ends of the "root" pieces, which gives the illusion that they extand deep into the base, which I also really like.</p>
                <p>Definitely the biggest selling point of this set is the ability to easily swap the leaves out and change them to the other version. I'm not exaggerating when I say it takes less than 2 minutes and requires no instructions to do so. Its very intuitive and adds a lot of value to the set, in my opinion. As for which version I personally prefer, I'm undecided really. I think what I'm going to do is swap them out when seasonally appropriate. Overall, it's a fantastic display piece if you're into this kind of thing. Even if you're not, I think it's instantly recognizable to most people, so even if you're not strictly a LEGO fan I think there's a lot of value to glean from having an ever-lasting, no maintenance Bonsai Tree.</p>
