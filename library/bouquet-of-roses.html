                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>For those that love LEGO Flowers and the Botanical Collection, you can now build the ultimate declaration of love with 10328 Bouquet of Roses, which was released on 1 January 2024, just in time for Valentine’s Day. The set does exactly what it says on the box, letting you and your (hopefully LEGO-obsessed) paramour build a dozen LEGO Roses, which are startingly realistic and could pass off as the real thing, except these won’t wilt and die. As LEGO’s Botanical collection blooms into its 3rd year of existence, it makes a lot of sense for LEGO to expand 40460 Roses and give it the proper LEGO Icons treatment, and the release is also timed to perfection as LEGO hopes this will be a popular gift and build with Valentine’s Day only 6 weeks away. Is there a lot to love about 10328 Bouquet of Roses or are they like Roses on Valentine’s Day - cliche and slightly overpriced? Let’s see in my review, and how it compares against a proper bouquet of roses.</p>
                <p>Like any good love story, it’s always better when it’s a shared experience and the LEGO Bouquet of Roses is designed from the ground up as a Build Together set. There are 3 separate instruction booklets, one for each type of rose - Rose Buds, a Blooming Rose and a Rose in Full Bloom (plus Baby’s Beath), so you could share the build with 2 other people. The build experience isn’t as good as other LEGO Botanicals, mostly because you’re working predominantly with red, and dark green, and there’s only one flower species you’re building, unlike the plethora of options that fans are accustomed to with 10280 Flower Bouquet or 10313 Wildflower Bouquet. There’s also a lot of repetition here, as you build 4x of each type of rose, and without the usual plethora of interesting elements, and recolors to surprise and delight during the build, this is definitely not a set that you buy to savor the build.</p>
                <p>10328 Bouquet of Roses does what it says on the box, build you a dozen boring but beautiful LEGO Roses. I kind of like the pure red color scheme, which is broken up by some small bunches of Baby’s Breath as it’s less busy and truly lets the design of the roses shine. The Baby’s Breath gives the Bouquet some volume, as well as introduce some small white flowers to break up the dominating use of red in the boutique. The stalks are flimsy, which were quite annoying when trying to hold the bouquet, as I found them snapping really easily. They look pretty, though.</p>
                <p>The Rose buds look tightly held together with that distinct vase-like silhouette. The use of a round 2x2 brick’s base, where you get a view of the anti-stud is quite clever visually, and there are also some rose sepals (the green structures that encase the buds) at the side make for some interesting visual elements. The next stage is the blooming Rose, which is now starting to take on a more curvaceous appearance, with the petal spirals on the inside starting to fully develop. I really like the technique used here, as well as the round 2x2 brick carried over from the previous stage for continuity, and just how plump and organic it looks. At certain angles, the Roses don’t look like they’re made of LEGO at all.</p>
                <p>And finally, we have the Rose in full bloom, with the petals opening to create the distinctive and iconic look of the world’s most recognizable flower. Again, I really like how the spirals open, ever so slightly, as well as the shoulder pieces recolored in red for the outer petals to give it a voluminous look. The one clever parts usage here, and it is an inspired one is the LEGO Whip in red, which is just the perfect element to capture the spiral at the heart of a blooming rose.</p>
                <p>I had to buy my very own bouquet of roses to compare the LEGO one to the actual thing and I was incredibly surprised at how good the LEGO Roses look alongside the real thing. Mind you, actual roses are expensive, and I can imagine they will be even pricier come Valentine’s Day, so the LEGO alternative might actually be a cost-effective alternative, especially with the added bonus that they’ll look great forever and not wilt and die. The size, spiral petals and vibrant colors do a good job at replicating the real thing, and while these are ornamental plastic flowers that you build yourself, I was surprised at how good it looks. Oh, and a LEGO Heart is included in the set as well, which is super cheesy, but super cute.</p>
                <p>At its core, this product feels a lot like Valentine’s Day - a product conceived to take advantage of a specific season, add on a huge markup for no particular reason and ultimately feels cliched. I get why LEGO have produced 10328 Bouquet of Roses - the LEGO Botanical Collection is one of their flagship best-sellers, and this is a really cute and thoughtful gift, especially for Valentine’s Day or for a loved one, but it really lacks the intrigue and surprise that you get with most LEGO Botanical sets. If you like roses or have a loved one that will love to receive a bunch of LEGO Roses, sure, this set will be a good buy, but if you’re like me and appreciate the LEGO Botanical sets for cunning build techniques and element usage, this is one to skip. That said, if you ever want to brighten up your living spaces with a vibrant bouquet of roses that will never die, these will definitely do a job.</p>
