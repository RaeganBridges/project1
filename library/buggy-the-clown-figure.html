                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The Buggy the Clown Figure is one of my favorite LEGO adaptations of the One Piece series. It stays true to the original media content, is fairly cheap, and has great printed pieces. Buggy is a fan favorite villain in this series for his idiocrasy and his ability to be a successful villain without doing anything that should be successful. While he isn’t my favorite character, I do have a love for his place in this series.</p>
                <p>Buggy is the best villain to adapt from One Piece because he is such a reoccurring character throughout the expansive issues and episodes of this series. His character design made for an interesting build that was enjoyable without being too overcomplicated or simple. The additional printed LEGO pieces definitely upgrade the set as a whole and enhance the look of it. I appreciate that the pieces were printed and not stickers that had to be applied from a sticker sheet, like many sets do to save cost.</p>
                <p>As a whole, this set was very fun and looks amazing when displayed. It strikes the perfect balance of LEGO and One Piece. I never thought that LEGO and One Piece would collaborate on a project like this together, but I am extremely happy that they did. This theme and the sets included are great. Hopefully, they may even bring fans of one brand over to the other, so that even more people can grow to love them.</p>
