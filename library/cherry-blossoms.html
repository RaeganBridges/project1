                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>I think it’s fair to say that the botanical collection is one of the most popular, attractive and innovative product lines at the moment, and one that is responsible for bringing many people into the hobby that would not have considered buying LEGO otherwise. These Cherry Blossoms are a pocket-money priced set, which is both an attractive model when displayed on its own, or with others in the collection.</p>
                <p>The two twigs are identical other than the color of the flowers. Building them is intricate and, it has to be said, somewhat tedious given that one is a repeat of the other. You’ll probably want to do what I did and split it over two sessions or maybe get someone else to build the second one. It is worth persevering, though, because the end result is a joy to behold!</p>
                <p>The flower heads are made using minifig crowns which were originally designed for Queen Watevra Wa’Nabi in The LEGO Movie 2 sets. They have been put to good use across the botanical range since. They are new here in light purple, and there are 37 of each color in the set, making it an ideal parts pack for creating your own flower designs. A combination of hinges allow the flower heads to be positioned in an organic way. Half of the heads have green leaves underneath them and the overall effect is very attractive.</p>
                <p>When displayed in a suitable vase they look wonderful. This is another excellent addition to the botanical range, and with its low price, you may well find yourself buying more than one, either to display more twigs, or to supplement your stock of pieces suitable for your own botanical builds.</p>
