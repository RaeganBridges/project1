                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The Christmas Decor Set is a neat little Christmas-themed box of LEGO decorations that has a little more to it than you may first expect. It is available at LEGO.com and in LEGO Stores from December 1, 2023, through to December 14, 2023, while stocks last, the Christmas Décor Set was awarded with LEGO purchases of $70.</p>
                <p>For that spend threshold, you receive a pack of three buildable bauble-style Christmas decorations in three different colors. While the design for the three is nigh-on identical (save the green one using 1x2 sloped bricks rather than 2x2 sloped bricks) and that does mean building them is rather repetitive, it's for a wider reason, which is that the sides to each decoration can come off and you can mix and match colors and patterns across the three.</p>
                <p>This simple yet effective option means that even though there are three decorations in the box, there are more than the one way each can look, depending on preference and creativity. For a relatively low spend threshold it's a nice touch that transforms 40604 Christmas Decor Set from a fairly straightforward LEGO gift-with-purchase into something smarter and more practical for whatever your decoration plans this holiday season.</p>
