                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>I initially bought the Christmas Tree set back when it first came out in 2022. The set is a 2-in-1 as well. You can build one large tree or two smaller trees. So, during the December 2024 double points event I went and I bought a second copy of the set. Then, I proceeded to build all three trees.</p>
                <p>The Christmas Tree (40573) is one of the best value sets I have reviewed in a while. In terms of build time, you potentially get a lot. Admittedly, not too many people are going to buy two of these in order to build multiple trees… but I did. The larger tree took me an hour and 25 minutes to assemble. The two smaller trees took me an hour and 37 minutes. So, building the smaller trees is a little more bang for your buck.</p>
                <p>I am probably a little biased when it comes to the build of this set. I love learning how to build LEGO® trees. In terms of build techniques, this set is nothing new. It is a very similar style to the GWP Christmas Tree from 2019, as well as the tree included with the Winter Village Toy Shop.</p>
                <p>With that said, the design uses simple bricks very effectively to create great looking conifers. While the build gets a little repetitive (especially when building three in a row), you end up with nice trees for any nature scene. The best part is that the Christmas Tree is a conifer kit ready to go at a good price. You don't have to source the parts yourself. Just leave the Christmas decor off as you build and you are good to go. However, if you build it as intended, you also get a great Holiday display piece.</p>
                <p>There is something I really dislike about the largest tree build though. The tree is split in two sections with only gravity holding them together. There is no interlocking stud/anti-stud connecting the two halves of the tree. On top of that, there is a rotating base built above the first layer of the top half. I can't imagine why anyone needs manually rotatable upper portion of a tree. It makes less sense when you look at the leftover bricks. There are enough parts meant for the alternate builds to fix the upper tree in place. It might make sense to make the tree splittable like this if that made it fit back in the box for storage. That could be useful for people only displaying the Christmas Tree seasonally. However, the tree does not fit back in the box once it is built without seriously dismantling sections of it. The split does not help at all.</p>
                <p>I love this set as a tree build. But due to the repetitive nature of it and what I see as a major design flaw, I only rate the build at 85%. The rotating, not-connected upper half of the large tree is stupid. The LEGO® Christmas Tree (40573) is a solid win in my books. Anyone who needs landscaping in their projects will appreciate this build. It goes well beyond being just a Christmas tree. I love this set because it offers the plans for three different tree sizes. This set really is a forest-building pack. If you buy two, like I did, you get three trees right off the bat.</p>
