                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The Creator 3-in-1 range has proven itself a perfect place for brick-built animal sets, and one of this year's newest is 31162 Cute Bunny. A smaller model than its sister set, 31165 Wild Animals: Panda Family, it contains roughly half the number of pieces for half the cost.</p>
                <p>The first of the three animals is the titular Cute Bunny. The bunny's colouring is mainly tan, with a white chest, nose, and cheeks. The tip of its nose is light nougat, matching the inside of its ears and paws, and helps create the bunny's cute appearance. Its head, ears, tail, and forelegs are attached with ball joints, and the rear legs with click rotation joints, allowing it be posed in a number of positions. When sat up on its haunches, it measures almost 20cm to the tips of its ears.</p>
                <p>From the rear, two large curved panels primarily make up the rabbit's back. Unfortunately, they don't fit entirely flush with the lower back, creating an odd step. The neck's ball joint is rather visible from this angle, but at least it is in a matching colour, unlike the grey of the ears and forelegs. The bunny's articulated joints enable you to pose the creature on all four legs, in the way they spend the majority of their time. The front paws can fold forwards, but the rear legs have no articulation within them, save the hip joints that allow them to rotate.</p>
                <p>Despite some oddities around the joints, the shape of the bunny is very realistic, and it looks good in both positions. The tail, ears, and head can all be adjusted well to add to the inquisitive look of the rabbit. A couple of small accessories are provided—a patch of grass with a dandelion and a lucky four-leaf clover, and a carrot, the stereotypical food of these furry vegetarian creatures. One small detail I loved that's not visible once the model is complete is the inclusion of a pink 1x1 heart tile hidden inside the bunny's chest—something that turned out to be included in all three models in the set. It makes no difference to the final build, but it made me smile and definitely added to the "cute" factor!</p>
                <p>The second animal you can build is a seal. Significantly smaller, it has the proportions more of a seal pup than an adult, with an oversized head and large eyes. Ball joints attach the front flippers, but the rear ones can only be rotated in or out, and twisted about their axis. Along with a little green fish, a small patch of ice and water is provided to rest the seal on. The shape is designed to fit neatly with the underside of the seal, but it does have a bit of wobble to it and doesn't sit securely. The head is attached by a ball joint, but the shape of the surrounding pieces means it has less possible movement than that of the bunny.</p>
                <p>Finally, the third animal portrayed by the set is a llama. With straight, spindly legs, and a long neck, the overall shape of the model feels pretty accurate—again, the proportions seem more akin to a young animal than an adult. The llama's traditionally tufty hair on top of the head is represented excellently by a rock plate, and the small ears and pink tip of the nose add to the cuteness. A small bush and carrot top are provided for additional interest. A yellow flower is tucked behind one of the llama's ears, and another rock plate is used for the small tail. While all four legs are attached by ball joints at the hips, the creature can only really stand up in one position, and even that feels very unstable. The neck can twist about quite a bit at its base, and the ears offer a surprising range of movement for added character.</p>
                <p>The bunny is very much the star of this set. The overall shape of the creature is very accurate, and I like how it can be posed in a variety of life-like positions, even holding the carrot as depicted on the box. I can see the cute appeal, and my children found it adorable. The other two models, however, feel more like filler to me than most Creator 3-in-1 sets, and I'm a little disappointed. They are both much smaller, more unstable, and much less appealing. I can't imagine this is a set many people would consider buying multiples of in order to build all the models simultaneously.</p>
