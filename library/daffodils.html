                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Since the launch of the hugely successful and superb Botanical Collection 18+ sets during 2020, LEGO has also released a number of smaller flower sets with a lower age rating. The Daffodils, however, are part of the core “adults welcome” Icons range and is the cheapest set to receive an 18+ marking.</p>
                <p>The set contains four narcissus blooms on stems made from regular green Technic axle connectors. The flower heads are fabricated using a 2x2 cone, a 3x3 dish, and six oval minifigure shields for petals. From the front it’s not obvious how the petals are connected. All is revealed at the back where it is clear how everything is connected.</p>
                <p>A better way of attaching leaves, closer to the stem and in a way that stops them rotating is needed: given the success and number of botanical sets being released maybe we’ll see a new element produced to solve the problem one day. They are a bit of a nuisance and are best “cut off” before displaying in a vase, as I have done. This is another excellent addition to the botanical collection that makes a great impulse purchase for yourself or an excellent gift.</p>
