                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>The Decorative Easter Egg is a great way to spruce up your space for Easter and the spring season. There are multiple theories as to where this practice originated from. However, there is evidence that egg dyeing existed in some ancient African civilizations. One of the more famous historical examples of this was performed by English King Edward I in 1290. He bought 450 colored eggs as gifts for his entourage as part of an Easter celebration. So, let’s take a crack at this LEGO set and see if it is as fun as the colors may make it appear.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite things about this set is the customization it offers builders. This 9+ LEGO set is a great way to get the entire family involved in Easter decorations and festivities. Plus, the top of the egg opens up to reveal a storage space inside. This nod to Fabergé eggs is a clever way to incorporate the beauty and alure of the decorative egg into a LEGO set.</p>
                <p>Seeing as the build is fairly easy and the cost of the set is relatively cheap, it would be fun activity to do with friends or family in the lead up to Easter. This set may even be an enjoyable holiday activity or gift. As someone who loves to decorate with seasonal LEGO sets, this build is a total win in my eyes.</p>
                <p>Overall, this set has my recommendation for LEGO builders young and old. The simplicity, customization, and functionality of this design make it a fantastic piece to display this holiday’s joy for years to come. This modern spin on old decorative egg traditions is egg-xactly what this Easter needs.</p>
