                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>The Easter Bunny and Chick Egg Hunt LEGO set was made in partner with the Decorative Easter Egg. These sets are fantastic ways to get your family egg-xcited for Easter. The Easter Bunny and Chick Egg Hunt plays off of the iconic Easter Bunny and Easter egg chicks. This Easter is the season to invest in this holiday toy.</p>
                <p>The cute brick-built animals include a bunny and chick. The bright-eyed chick is a symbol for spring, fertility, and rebirth in ancient Easter traditions. Meanwhile, the bunny is a reference to the Easter Bunny. This comes from German Lutheran traditions that was brought to America by immigrants during the 1700s. The German Easter Hare is also a symbol of fertility and new life.</p>
                <p>This LEGO set brings together the bunny and chick to harken back to their traditional symbolism in a way that is fun and enjoyable for all ages. To continue on with the German tradition, an Ostereierbaum (German for "Easter egg tree") is also included. The eggs in the tree dive more into the religious aspects of the holiday. The tree is connected to wooden cross that Jesus was hung on and the eggs represent the empty tomb of new life.</p>
                <p>This LEGO set has much more meaning that one would egg-xpect at first glance. However, it gives families and individuals the perfect opportunity to learn about the tradition behind the Easter holiday. This build is very approachable and doable for a young audience, giving them the chance to learn and celebrate Easter this season.</p>
