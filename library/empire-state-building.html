                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The Empire State Building is perhaps the most famous skyscraper in the USA, if not the world. Its distinctive art deco style also makes it one of the most attractive. At 443m high it was the tallest building in the world until 1970 so all in all it's no wonder that it's a popular subject for LEGO's Architecture series to model. This is the third version, following on from 21002, one of the first Architecture sets, and a similarly scaled but more detailed version in 21028 New York City skyline released in 2016. This new one, 21046, which stands at 55cm tall, dwarfs them both and upon first inspection looks to be a bit of a boring and repetitive build given that it's big, square and there are 684 1x2 grille tiles to attach, but that's not the case at all.</p>
                <p>The building sits on a 26x16 base which as usual is bordered with tiles including a printed one. Roads populated with yellow cabs occupy the first few studs along the sides. It's a shame there isn't a bit of variety in the cars, given that cabs are far from being the only vehicles on the road in the city. Take note of the four sets of escalators leading from the ground floor now, because you won't see them again!</p>
                <p>What could have been a dull and boring build was actually anything but. Yes, there are a lot of grille tiles to attach but unlike affixing 1x1 pieces which need to be meticulosity aligned, it was not arduous at all. In fact, there is a refreshing lack of 1x1 pieces in the set, which helps keep the pace of building up. The roof tops of the various protrusions from the main tower are all light grey which is probably realistic and also helps provide some contrast to the predominantly tan coloured building.</p>
                <p>There's something special about the design of the building: its proportions, its rocket-like appearance, its art-deco styling.This model allows you to really appreciate all of this in a way that's perhaps difficult in NYC. Not only is the finished model a joy to behold, it's also a pleasure to construct. The core uses some interesting building techniques, and you're not constantly bogged down aligning tiny 1x1 pieces, so it's a pleasant and relatively quick experience, despite all the grille tiles. Architecture sets are not usually very cost effective parts packs but this one makes a pretty good one.</p>
