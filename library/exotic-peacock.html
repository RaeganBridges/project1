                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The peacock is, according to Charles Darwin, "the most splendid of living birds" and 31157 Exotic Peacock looks to be the most splendid of the Creator 3-in-1 sets that have just been launched, so it was a day one purchase for me. In this part of the review I look at the main model. I will examine the alternate builds, a butterfly and dragonfly in due course.</p>
                <p>The peacock, the male of the peafowl species, has iridescent blue and green plumage and a huge train of beautiful feathers covered with eyespots which it fans out during courtship. With its feathers on display, the model looks spectacular, with a wingspan of about 30cm. Three-leaved plant pieces have been used to good effect to form the eyespots, including gold ones for the more elaborate and larger ones at the tips of the feathers. The bird's body looks suitably curvaceous and colourful, made with pieces in three shades of blue and purple. The backs of the feathers are neat and tidy, and just like on the real bird, fairly drab. A pair of large curved pieces form the fowl's tail feathers which touch the ground to stop the model from tipping backwards. That is not necessary when the feathers are fanned but is when they are folded back.</p>
                <p>Some wonderful parts usage is evident here for the the crest on top of the bird's head. All eight feathers are hinged: the bottom two with click hinges, the others with Mixel ball joints, which allows them to be folded backwards and tidily interleaved. Just like the real creature, it is eye-catching and spectacular: a model that exemplifies the novelty and inventiveness of the Creator 3-in-1 theme, which continues to yield many of the best models in LEGO's annual assortment. My only complaint is that the bird is so beautiful that I don't want to take it apart to build the other models.</p>
