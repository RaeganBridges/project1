                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>I've been a fan and collector of the LEGO Botanical Collection sets since the theme first kicked off with the Flower Bouquet and Bonsai Tree back in 2021, choosing largely to fill my home with beautiful, plastic brick-built flora over the easily-neglected real thing. Over the years, I've enjoyed the various bouquets that have launched for their top notch LEGO renditions of wonderfully varied and vibrant flowers and flexibility of putting them in any regular vase, but tended to favour sets like the Orchid, Bird of Paradise or even the adorable Succulents and Tiny Plants—simply because they feel more “complete” and ready for display. That's why the new 10345 Flower Arrangement is so exciting, combining the best of both Botanical worlds with a big, ready-to-display set complete with LEGO vase and guided presentation, as well as an assortment of gorgeous flowers that allows for a bit of added flexibility and personal touch. This 1,161-piece set will be one of the biggest undertakings for a LEGO Botanical Collection fan, but the results are more than worth it.</p>
                <p>I actually kinda wish more LEGO boxes were like this, it's a much easier way to organise and store the bags as you're going through them. The hefty, 135-page instruction booklet kicks things off nicely as well, highlighting all of the flowers in the set and offering up a bit of information on each of them, which I enjoyed referring back to as I was building to give every step a bit of context and to understand the story behind the overall arrangement.</p>
                <p>Similar to other vase-bound LEGO Botanical Collection sets, like the Orchid and Bird of Paradise, this build starts off with the construction of a uniquely-designed vase that gives the illusion of being hollow but actually features a series of tiles with vertical bars on top that are where you'll attach the stem of each flower. The vase build is actually fairly simple in comparison to some of the others, with fewer Technics elements, but the end result is still quite pleasing. The top is a sort of mound shape as well with a couple of levels, which goes a long way to giving the finished arrangement its dynamic and layered look. I can see some builders being a little disappointed with the plain ceramic-white vase, embellished only by a trim towards the lip, and it's a bit gappy in spots (especially the base) but at the end of the day it's going to be overshadowed entirely by the main event, anyway - a splendid assortment of 14 flowers.</p>
                <p>First up is the Night Rider camellia (Camellia x williamsii), which hails from the UK and is described in the instruction booklet as a dark, evergreen shrub adorned with the striking dark red/maroon flowers. The look of the golden anthers in the centre is achieved with a smattering of golden t-bars and bar holders, while the semi-double petal array uses a technique perfected in other floral sets with layered rows attached to bar frames and then closed in. It's really satisfying to attach all of the big, red dish pieces and then close them all in your hand to produce a finished flower - and there's no denying they look fantastic. The size of these LEGO blooms is quite impressive.</p>
                <p>Next are the Itoh Peonies (Paeonia Itoh), which as you might guess from the name are peonies originally cultivated in Japan (this is going to be a nicely multicultural assortment of flowers!). The instruction booklet amusingly points out that these LEGO versions are guaranteed to bloom all year round—something that can't usually be said of the actual Itoh Peony which blooms for about a month.</p>
                <p>Hydrangeas (Hydrangea arborescens) are a classic, so it's great to see a couple of lovely purple ones in the mix here. The construction of these is also a great nod to the Botanical Collection series' penchant for reusing pieces in unique ways. First we had pink frogs for cherry blossoms, then recoloured Demagorgon heads in the Orchid, now we've got rows of purple butterflies acting as the hydrangeas' sepals. Attaching these butterflies was probably one the fiddler and more trying parts of this whole build, not just because they're very exact in number and position to give that clustered look, but also because I wasn't paying enough attention to notice you're meant to invert every second butterfly on the larger rows. Consider this your heads up.</p>
                <p>Following a bag dedicated to embellishing our first row of flowers with a bit of greenery, and a couple sprigs of Baby's Breath (Gypsophila paniculata), we're on to one of the most interesting flowers in this set—the Persian Buttercup or Ranunculus. The Persian Buttercup is a stunning flower in real life, native to many parts of the globe and with its thin, densely-packed petals coming in a huge range of colours. The version here is a wonderful assortment of orange hues, but the thing that makes this unique is the way that the designer, Wes Talbott, have replicated the twirling, closed-in look of the Persian Buttercup's petals.</p>
                <p>The next pairing of plants, the Hummingbird flowers (Bourvardia) were definitely my least favourite in this entire build. These dainty flowers were quite fiddly to put together, especially with the way that the outer petals (which uses pieces originally designed to be wings for a LEGO Ladybird) sit very loosely while you secure the bottom leaf and stem. I wasn't necessarily having a bad time with these, they're just small and unremarkable compared to all of the others.</p>
                <p>Luckily, the final piece is another very striking one with the Lily flower (Lilium) adding a big, bold burst of orange and green to the whole arrangement. Pretty straightforward to build with their six large petals made from newly-coloured plant plates and two green leaves, but gorgeous once completed and added to the rest of the display. For any wand collectors out there, this also includes a heap of new green wand pieces for the stamen, with a lot of spares left by the end.</p>
                <p>Speaking as someone with a strong preference for following LEGO set instructions to the absolute nth degree to ensure my finished model looks exactly like what's in the box, I'm pretty happy with the way that the Flower Arrangement's instruction manual offers a clear diagram on where each flower is placed, every step of the way. Like any real-world arrangement, there's a lot going on here by the end, so having a bird's-eye layout that updates with every new plant is incredibly helpful.</p>
                <p>And the end result is easily the best-looking Botanical Collection/flower set so far! I'm in love with how full and varied and vibrant this looks, it really is a marvel of both LEGO design and floristry. Of course, the beauty of a set like this is the ability to add your own creative flair, and this is not only supported with the Flower Arrangement but downright encouraged. The flower heads and stems are set up so that they're super easy to swap around at will, and there are plenty of spare bars on the vase top to add even more or move things around as you'd like.</p>
                <p>10345 Flower Arrangement is easily one of the best Botanical Collection sets since the theme began, bringing the best of the worlds of the vase-based and bouquet sets to create something fun to build and gorgeous to look at. It's a great composition of flower species, all of which I had a blast learning about as I was going and most of which are exciting to build. If you're anything like me and love displaying LEGO plants around the house, this one is destined to command pride-of-place, so the fact that it's been designed to accommodate both studios instruction-followers and creative customisers is a masterstroke. It might be on the less-affordable end of the Botanical spectrum, and some sections are more tedious than others, but if you're into the theme it'll absolutely be worth your time and money.</p>
