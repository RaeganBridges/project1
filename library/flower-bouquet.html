                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>In LEGO's pursuit of older fans, the toy manufacturer has overhauled their adult product strategy, resulting in an immediate expansion of adult-focused sets. One of the ways this has manifested is an attempt to bring in new adult buyers with sets focusing on non-traditional subjects that might fit better into a grown-up decor. Enter the LEGO Botanical Collection, first announced last month, which includes two sets designed to seamlessly blend into a modern aesthetic with models that will look equally at home on your desk or in your den.</p>
                <p>The Flower Bouquet comes in a large box-larger than its $50 price point would indicate and contains six bags of parts across three numbered steps, plus the instruction manual which is safely packaged in its own bag. There is no sticker sheet, and in fact, the set contains no decorated elements at all. And although the set doesn't have any wholly new elements, the parts are a smorgasbord of interesting new colors.</p>
                <p>The instructions constructs the flowers one variety at a time, combining duplicates where possible. For instance, the two daisies are identical and so get a 2x in the manual. Meanwhile the three roses have two variations with a straight and a curved stem, and so only the rose flowers are built at the same time with a 3x multiplier. Some of the flowers have a simple stem consisting of the Technic axle, while others have more complex stems with stacked Technic 3L axle connectors.</p>
                <p>The daisies are the least successful of the six flowers and are easily lost among the larger bouquet. I honestly don't think I'd recognize them as daisies except perhaps by the white-and-yellow key colors. A different solution is needed that makes larger, more distinct petals. These hardly look like you could play He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not by plucking off petals one at a time.</p>
                <p>The roses are gorgeous, and instantly recognizable. The light nougat peach color isn't my favorite (despite being excited about the parts themselves) as I would have preferred either something more vibrant, or crisp white roses, but in conjunction with the saturated poppy and snapdragons, the result is elegant and understated. Like the daisy, the California Poppy is a simple flower. The center of the bud is a tightly packed assembly that let the yellow clips work as stamen. Four orange car hoods attach onto the outer clips for the poppy's four orange petals.</p>
                <p>Next to the daisy, the poppy is my least favorite of the flowers. The final result is a little too precise with the four petals being a bit too square. I'm not sure what a better solution would have been, but viewed in the bouquet surrounded by the other flowers it's not as noticeable. And with only one in the set, it provides a nice pop of warm color to offset the purples of the aster, lavender, and snapdragons.</p>
                <p>The snapdragon is next, and was my favorite to build. Although the assembly was a bit tedious, the result is splendid. A center of octagonal plates provides a mounting point for the snapdragon's tiny buds. The picture below illustrates the constituent parts along with an assembled flower (minus the stem) on the left. Snapdragons can be found in a wide variety of colors, and I'm already generating ideas for recolors of this build.</p>
                <p>Finally, the aster. A complex and delicate flower, the aster's build is a series of concentric circles of tiny petals (34 petals in total). Like the lavender, it's not an engaging build, but the result is beautiful. Asters are a huge family of flowers encompassing a wide range of varieties. Initially I thought this aster didn't look like the asters I was familiar with, and that's true. What I had in mind was more of a purple daisy (and in fact, daisies are closely related). But some varieties of aster have tightly bunched petals and uniform color, and this LEGO design does a splendid recreation of them.</p>
                <p>The bushy sprigs likely represent a real plant, but I'm not a florist so I'll leave it to the experts to say exactly what this is. In any case, it serves the same purpose here that it would in a real bouquet-to add volume and visual balance. They're extremely simple but do the job well. Likewise, the leaves also add visual balance and interest to the bouquet.</p>
                <p>The Flower Bouquet is one of the few sets that can't really be displayed on its own, without adding something else. You'll need to use either a standard flower vase or construct one if you prefer to keep it all brick. I opted for the glass vase, and I think it would make a wonderful addition to an office. No matter how professional the office you work in, these flowers will fit in with the decor. At a higher price, I'd merely classify this set as a fun novelty. But for $50, it's cheaper than many real flower bouquets and will last significantly longer, while bringing some nerdy fun to your decor in an elegant manner. It would also be easy to expand with either the official flower sets or more flowers of your own.</p>
