                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Lotus flowers, or Nelumbo nucifera, are aquatic plants native to Asia. They are a symbol of purity, spiritual enlightenment, and rebirth, and are sacred in many Eastern cultures. The Lotus Flowers, a supplementary set to the hugely popular botanical collection, contains three stems of this exquisite bloom.</p>
                <p>The set consists of a white and a pink flower fully open, and a pink one yet to bloom. The stems are fabricated using regular green 2l axle joiners, 48 in total, with a bright green pin joiner at the top of the unopened one. The pieces on the ends of the petals are new in pink, while the cool yellow hubcap, which adds delicate detail to the stamen, was also used for the same purpose in 10313 Wildflower Bouquet.</p>
                <p>It's another attractive and delightful addition to the hugely successful botanical series. Priced at just $12.99 for over 200 pieces, it's also something of a bargain worthy of impulse purchase. Plus, it is a great set to display as decoration.</p>
