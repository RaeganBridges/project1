                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>To quote the Beatles: "All you need is love." This set is based on the famous Robert Indiana image. Let's see if it is, indeed, all we need. Most people are familiar with the Robert Indiana image, made famous when it was featured in a New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) greeting card in 1965. This led to many incarnations of the image, including being featured on a U.S. stamp in 1973. Subsequent sculptures can be found in many countries around the world; the original monumental sculpture was created in 1970 and is currently on display at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.</p>
                <p>Inside the box there are nine numbered bags and two instruction books. The first of the instruction books provides some history on the LOVE image, as well as some schmaltzy language about how sometimes people "just click", and how this set will "fall into place". The two instruction books offer an opportunity to build with someone else; the instruction book helpfully suggests this would be a great date activity.</p>
                <p>The model is built in two sections (one per instruction book). The first is the "L" and "E" of the sculpture. These letters are built independently, with just a few bricks connecting them at the end. I was surprised when they stood on their own, albeit tilted slightly. These two letters have blue as their highlighted colour, similar to the original image.</p>
                <p>The "O" piece has some nice techniques to provide the rounding of the letter. The "V" piece is straightforward to built, but the hinges are not locked, which means it doesn't stand up on its own. Both "O" and "V" have green highlighting. The "O" and "V" click into place (much like how the booklet describes it!). However, you can see the connecting plate between the "O" and the "E", but I'm not sure there's anything the designer could have done to make it more flush.</p>
                <p>A side view shows the highlighting in the letters, as well as one of my other small nitpicks - the gaps in the top of the curve of the "O". Again, it's such a smooth curve and turned out quite well, minus the gap. The size is not too large - it's about 10 inches in height. It is just the right size to display in an office.</p>
                <p>When I was building this set, I was thinking that it was too bad this wasn't available for Christmas. Almost more importantly, the build is not overly complex, so would be a perfect gift for someone just starting out in the hobby. Then it dawned on me that this is being released in anticipation for Valentine's Day, which also explains the schmaltzy language in the instruction book. At $80, it may be just the right set for you to get for someone you connect with.</p>
