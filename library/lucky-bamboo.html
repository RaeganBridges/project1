                <h3>Biography</h3>               
                <p>It was inevitable that LEGO was going make the other pair of plants in the quartet known in Chinese art as the 'Four Gentlemen', following the release of 10368 Chrysanthemum and 10369 Plum Blossom earlier this year. 10344 Lucky Bamboo, the subject of this review, and 10343 Mini Orchid, were launched on 1st January, 2025. The humble bamboo may not be the most attractive of them, but this set should not be overlooked.</p>
                <p>There are a number of tiles printed with an 'end of bamboo' pattern and also one printed with a coin-like pattern. The plant is about 30cm tall and, like the best Botanicals, looks just like the real thing from a distance. The wheelchair wheels are a slightly larger diameter than the 2x2 round bricks, so they look just like the protruding joints that you find on real shoots. The combination of greens used in the plant really pop and contrast wonderfully with the earthy tones of the pot and surrounding pebbles.</p>
                <p>It's not a challenging build by any means: three similar shoots, three identical twigs and nine sets of leaves, but when it's all assembled, I think it looks magnificent. Small 'pebbles' are used to fill the gaps around the shoots in the pot and, like the plant, they look very realistic from a distance. The nature of bamboo does not give the designer much to work with but, nevertheless, they have done an excellent job in creating an attractive and realistic model, one which is sure to delight fans of the botanicals series, especially if they have others in this range.</p>
