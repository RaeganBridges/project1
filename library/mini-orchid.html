                <h3>Biography</h3>    
                <p>The Mini Orchid one of the two four gentlemen - plants that are often depicted in Chinese art and gardens - that was launched on January 1st, 2025, joining the pair that were released earlier this year. They are all attractive on their own, but look even better when displayed together. Yet, the Mini Orchid may be one of the most beautiful pieces on its own.</p>
                <p>The perennial herb stands in a nougat-coloured 'terracotta' pot which is different, but stylistically similar, to those the other three plants are potted in. Four leaves surround the stem made from Technic axle-joiners, which is held upright by a cane built using brown candlesticks. Five flowers are in full bloom and others in various stages of development occupy the the end of the stalk. It looks wonderful from the front but a bit messy from behind, where all the exposed Technic joints are visible.</p>
                <p>The large pair of leaves utilise the shell pieces first used at the back of 10295 Porsche 911, while the smaller ones each use four of what I believe to be a new part, a 2x2 corner round piece. Both methods have resulted in very realistic-looking leaves. The five light nougat flower heads are identical and a bit fiddly to construct. They are built around a gold 'Sonic ring' and utilise the new clip with stud piece that is causing much excitement in the community to hold two of the minifig shields in place. The buds at the end of the shoot are eggs, new here in bright green, and lime green tulip heads which were introduced in 21353 The Botanical Garden. It's life-sized and easily mistaken for the real thing. The leaves in particular look spot-on.</p>
                <p>LEGO has delivered a wonderful collection of sets forming the four gentlemen, and I am hard-pressed to pick a favourite. I love the simplicity of the bamboo, the vibrant colour of the chrysanth, the gnarly shape of the plum blossom and the realism of the orchid. They look great individually, and even better together, and I am sure anyone who buys one will want to buy them all. At $29.99 they are not exactly cheap although, when looking at the set as a whole, $120 doesn't seem too outrageous when compared to what you're expected to pay for licenced sets these days.</p>
