                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>I really enjoyed building the Monkey D. Luffy Figure LEGO set. I am not particularly a fan of the Brickheadz LEGO builds, but this was a good introduction to them. This figure is of Monkey D. Luffy, the main character from a popular, ongoing manga, anime, and Netflix live-action adaptation. This Brickheadz set was released alongside a Brickheadz Buggy the Clown Figure and the One Piece LEGO theme builds. All of this was in response to the Netflix live-action adaptation that brought even more eyes onto this major series.</p>
                <p> I liked this set because it does not lean into the Netflix adaptation of the manga and anime like the larger sets in the One Piece theme. As a fan of those medias, I love that the Netflix live-action adaptation has gotten this series even further publicized, but staying true to the original content makes it feel more interesting. Instead, some of these sets feel like adaptations of adaptations, which isn’t the best way to produce these. In my opinion, the Brickheadz are much more successful ways of adapting these designs because they don’t isolate themselves to any of the media forms of the One Piece series.</p>
                <p>While this build was very straightforward, relaxing, fun, and easy, I did have some problems with the pieces. At only $9.99, this set is very cheap, especially because it includes printed pieces. However, the skin tones on some of the printed pieces, like the chest piece, were slightly different colors than the skin tone used on other pieces. This is not the biggest deal considering the low price point, but it would have been nice to see it be a little more cohesive.</p>
                <p>Overall, this set was fun to build for a fan of both LEGO and One Piece. This build was a great pastime and looks amazing on the shelf in my room. As someone who does not collect much merchandise of medias I am a fan of, I can say that I have no regrets buying this set. The simplicity is great for any fans or LEGO builders. I would absolutely buy this again and I can’t wait to see what LEGO releases next in relation to this theme.</p>
