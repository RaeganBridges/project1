                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The current gift with purchase at LEGO.com is 40586 Moving Truck, which is free with purchases in excess of $180. The 301-piece set has been designed to complement this year’s modular building 10312 Jazz Club which, presumably, is under new management. It’s an interesting set that not only provides a period vehicle to populate the modular street but also additional furniture that can be used to flesh out the interior of the club, or any other building for that matter.</p>
                <p>It comes with a 6-sticker sheet provides decorations for the vehicle. Two minifigures are provided, both of whom appear to be removal company workers going by the picture on the box, despite the male being dressed in a jumper. Both have alternate expressions which are perhaps appropriate for when they are struggling to move heavy objects.</p>
                <p>The van is huge compared to the size of the figures, but then most are nowadays. The cab is 4-wide and the back 6 and is somewhat reminiscent of such vehicles from the 1940s and 50s. The set comes with a piece of modern art, an organ, a jukebox, table, moving box and a sack barrow. Surprisingly, yes, it all fits! The instructions show how to squeeze it all in, even with the table drawer open and lamp on top. A ramp is provided to ease loading and unloading, which neatly stows away underneath the floor of the van.</p>
