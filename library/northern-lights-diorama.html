                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The LEGO 40785 Northern Lights Diorama GWP (gift with purchase) was available with purchases of $150 or more on LEGO.com until 20 October 2025 alongside LEGO's concurrent Double Points promotion. It's the fourth and final set in LEGO's Wonders of the Natural World GWP series, with a focus on a Northern Hemisphere landscape with a skyscape, and Aurora Borealis. These Wonders of the Natural World dioramas have been released in each quarter of the year, and have been a pretty fun cycle to collect with the focus on different landscapes that celebrate Earth's natural beauty.</p>
                <p>The 40785 Northern Lights Diorama is probably my favourite of the series, but I can't quite explain why. I've never seen the Northern Lights or have been up North in the winter months, but there's something very serene about the composition of the model. It's unique in that it has a night sky background, which none of the other dioramas has, and there also isn't a single animal or creature in this, which wouldn't quite work at this scale.</p>
                <p>The build of this 332-piece set went by very quickly, and there are 4 numbered bags in total. The final bag places the snow-topped trees in, and it's quite a nice finishing touch to the model as it looks extremely bare without the conifers! There is a lot of repetition with this model, mind you, and it definitely wasn't as “fun” or varied compared to the other GWPs in this series. The focal point of the model is the dark sky, with aurora borealis in the sky, represented by dark pink and pearlescent green tiles. It's a very simple way to represent the Northern Lights, but again, it works reasonably well at this scale.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure this works as well, but on the floor, amidst the white snow banks, and satin blue tiles that represent frozen lakes or a river, the Northern Lights are reflected on the surface. I get what the designer was going for here, but the use of 1x2 plates and tiles makes this look a bit too much like a checkerboard, and I would've liked a bit more of an organic shape to make it look less like multicoloured cobblestones. There is a glow in the dark 1x1 round tile for the moon which is neat. But what really brings the model to life, and in my opinion, mimics the natural beauty of Aurore Borealis, is when you blast the model with a blacklight in a dark room, which illuminates the satin green tiles and plates with a gorgeous glow!</p>
                <p>What I don't like of course, is that with any GWP, these being a quarterly release means that you'd have to time your purchases very specifically throughout the year, which isn't the easiest thing to do as it means you need to make 4 different transactions of $150 or more. That's not the easiest to do for the average LEGO fan, but thankfully, there aren't any unique or exclusive element in these sets, so you could easily rebuild these out of your spare parts, or by ordering the elements individually if you like the look of the LEGO Natural Wonders of the World Dioramas.</p>
