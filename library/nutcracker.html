                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>LEGO began selling this cute brick-built 40640 LEGO Nutcracker as seasonal Christmas set on 1 September 2023. 40640 LEGO Nutcracker is part of LEGO's Iconic theme, which means that it was only available from LEGO.com and LEGO Stores. It's never too early for a quick preview of this delightfully charming two-in-one LEGO Nutcracker. It is one of the stars of the 2023 LEGO Seasonal lineup. LEGO Iconic sets usually provide quick and accessible builds, and this one is no exception to the rule. There are no stickers in this set, which is always welcome, and means that the LEGO elements need to do the heavy lifting when it comes to decorations.</p>
                <p>LEGO has a long and storied history with Nutcrackers with GWPs (40254 Nutcracker), Brickheadz (40425 Nutcracker), and even an LEGO Employee Exclusive (4002017 Nutcracker), and even a Collectible Minifigure (Series 23's Nutcracker), but 40640 LEGO Nutcracker is the first working buildable version that you can easily purchase, which makes this a win for fans of this traditional German doll. The Nutcracker was a really nice build, with fantastic sculpting and clever use of elements despite the relatively low-piece count. The techniques used to shape the face, hair and in particular the nose and eyebrows are top tier, accurately bringing the Nutcracker's iconic features to life in a very LEGO way.</p>
                <p>I also really like the simple yet effective construction of the Nutcracker's toy soldier's hat, which can also be removed if you wish. The Nutcracker's most defining feature, its mouth complete with movable jaw to crack open nuts is rendered quite nicely here, and I particularly like the overly happy expression! To add an extra bit of customizability, LEGO have also included an alternate design, where you can alter the Nutcracker's face and head to change up the look. It's a small but welcome cosmetic change that injects a bit more value into the build and gives it some degree of customization which I do appreciate.</p>
                <p>For Christmas-themed seasonal sets, 40640 LEGO Nutcracker is definitely one of the more memorable ones and I'm really glad to see LEGO leaning into more traditional holiday designs, as opposed to animal and snowy-type builds we've had in previous years. The festive traditional Nutcracker is a familiar sight for many and such an enduring symbol of Christmas that it makes a lot of sense for LEGO to revisit at this scale. As a display piece, this is really quite solid and its size and relatively affordable price tag makes this a fun set to build and display, especially if you enjoy decorating your home in the leadup to Christmas. The colors and vibrant, and the function make this more than just a Nutcracker statue and this is just a well-executed seasonal LEGO set that I think will appeal to a wide range of people and also work as an inexpensive Christmas gift for LEGO-loving people in your life.</p>
