                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>LEGO's Botanical Collection has been one of LEGO's fastest growing Creator Expert subthemes, and for 2022, LEGO have introduced 2 other sets -  10311 Orchid and 10309 Succulents. They are extremely popular as they'll appeal to both longtime and non-LEGO fans, as well as make for incredibly fun gifts in the leadup to Mother's Day. My first review from the 2022 LEGO Botanical Collection is 10311 Orchid, which is quite simply a work of art, and one of the most visually impressive sets LEGO have ever put on sale, that's also relatively affordable and accessible. If you love house plants, flowers, or unique LEGO experiences, you're going to want to add the LEGO Orchid to your wishlist.</p>
                <p>At 608 pieces, the LEGO Orchid isn't a particularly lengthy build, and it's just the right length to give you a satisfying experience, without feeling tedious. The start is a little daunting, with the assembly of the core of the fluted vase - Technic bars are used across, which may be a little awkward for those not used to building with Technic, but the bright cornucopia of colours will do its best to distract your attention. The second bag sees you assemble the exterior of the fluted vase or pot, with a generous helping of triangular sand blue roofs, which are incredibly satisfying to snap into place. Bag 3 has you building the leaves, potting mix, and roots...before you finish off the build putting the Orchid flowers into place!</p>
                <p>Here's the completed LEGO Orchid, and this was a truly special LEGO set to behold. It makes such an impressive statement, and like most of the LEGO sets in the Botanical Collection, plays tricks on your eyes as it'll make you stop and rethink whether this is an actual living plant, or a bunch of ABS plastic parts cobbled together. The Orchid has all the essential ingredients for a exceptional display piece - it has height, attractive colours, and a larger-than-life footprint, thanks to the large leaves, and sand blue vase - all of which work in harmony to catch your gaze. It's honestly one of the most life-like LEGO models I've ever built, and I found it hard to believe that it only costs $49.99 which is simply astounding value for what you're getting on display.</p>
                <p>It's not just the visual aesthetics that disarm you. I had the most visceral experience when I picked the Orchid up with both hands grasping the vase, as it felt exactly like a ceramic vase. Thanks to the sand blue roof elements, which have a slightly porous and matte texture to them, it actually feels like you're holding an actual ceramic pot as the textures and how it feels in hand, which is such a bizarre experience. From that moment on, I knew that this was going to be a very special LEGO set, and I began wondering how intentional the choice of material was to evoke that feeling.</p>
                <p>Like the Bonsai Tree and Bird of Paradise before it, the LEGO Orchid also has potting mix, and stuff inside the vase, in this case, some chunks of bark to retain moisture in the soil. Two roots are seen snaking out, which is another really wonderful touch, and I also liked the dark brown tentacle, which looks like a dead roof, or stem rotting, which is a very common sight if you have house plants. I wasn't a fan of the leaves, as I felt like while the shapes were seemingly accurate, they are a little too glossy and reflective for me, which does make it look quite plasticky, and if you put it on display, you'll likely see bright balls of light reflected on it from the lights in your home.</p>
                <p>There are 6 Orchids in full bloom, 2 smaller blossoms, and 2 buds, and you're encouraged to adjust and personalise the arrangement by twisting and manipulating the Technic stems, allowing you to alter the shape as you please. The Orchid flowers are in full bloom - they're created from a mix of Constraction shoulder pads, white shields, forks, and knob gears in pink for the first time, and magenta frogs! A hodge-podge of elements that Mike Psiaki has somehow figured would come together to accurately mimic an Orchid. The use of frogs are inspired here, as they have an odd organic shape, and the way they're angled against the light pink lips look almost natural. The frogs, are also likely a nod to the LEGO Bonsai, designed by Nick Vas which famously employed 100 pink frogs to act as cherry blossoms.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most surprising element used - it surprised me when dozens of white forks popped out of the bag. These forks are used to hold the shields in place! But perhaps the most interesting surprise, and another shining example of nice part usage is the use of recoloured Demogorgon heads (yes Demogorgon Heads from the now-retired Stranger Things set) - which are cast in white, and have Orchid flowers printed on them. They serve as juvenile Orchid blooms, which are beginning to emerge - I guess the closest we got to Orchid bulbs hanging from the stems.</p>
                <p>The LEGO Orchid looks marvellous on display, and if you're like me and have a modest houseplant collection, it should be incredibly easy to incorporate the Orchid in your homes. It seamlessly blends in, and has the right size and scale to disguise itself as an Orchid, except this one is immortal, and won't require finicky conditions to bloom. It goes without saying, 10311 Orchid is an exceptional LEGO set, and one of the most impressive sets ever released to the market, all for the low, low price of under $50. It ticks all the boxes for me, and is an incredible case study of just what can be made possible out of LEGO, and an astonishing display of Mike Psiaki's talent, and eye for detail. This is a masterclass of LEGO design, and it's also bolstered by the fact that you can customise and personalise the Orchid's arrangement to your liking, also adds to the appeal. As a display model, it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous and just oozes display presence. You can set this up on your desk at work, or in your home, and it instantly elevates its surroundings.</p>
                <p>It's larger, has more interesting and rarer elements, and has more LEGO included, and honestly, I'm surprised LEGO didn't price this closer to the Bird of Paradise. While its beautiful and all, LEGO sets targeted at adults have always had a “see but don't touch” vibe about them, but I just cannot forget the visceral feeling I had when I held the vase, and it actually felt like a ceramic vase. It's hard to put into words, as it's a sensorial experience, but you'll get it when you get this set in your hands. I don't know why, but feeling has stayed with me as it's unlike anything LEGO have ever done. I recommend the LEGO Orchid to absolutely everybody, and this would also make a remarkable gift to non-LEGO enthusiasts, or as an introduction to LEGO. It's a rare, near-perfect set that will absolutely delight and thrill you. It does have a few small flaws, which are just minor peeves such as the leaves being too glossy and reflective, or the lack of closed buds, but they don't detract from what is the closest we'll get to a perfect LEGO set and experience that will not break the bank.</p>
