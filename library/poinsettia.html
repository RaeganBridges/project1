                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>We’re big fans of LEGO’s Botanical Collection here at TBB; heck, it inspired a whole collaborative display at BrickCon recently. It seems to be popular with the public at large, too, as new sets keep popping up. One of the latest to be announced is LEGO Icons 10370 Poinsettia - a flower native to Mexico with, believe it or not, a link to the holiday season.</p>
                <p>This LEGO model depicts the Grande Italia variant of the poinsettia, with its vibrant red bracts and petals. Although presumably chosen for its popularity, I really like the choice of colors - dark red and dark green work so well together! The yellow stigma and light nougat pot are the perfect offset to these darker colors.</p>
                <p>If there’s a criticism to be made of how it looks, it’s perhaps that the smaller flowers don’t quite look as impressive as their larger counterparts. It’s probably driven by the use of the ninja stars, but they feel a little flat to me. Not distractingly so - it’s a small nitpick, as the whole ensemble does look great.</p>
                <p>I appreciate the detail of the woven basket, too. The texture is very convincing. It would be easy to make these pots an afterthought, but it’s clear that the care designers afford to the “botanical” element of the Botanical Collection also extends to their containers. It’s little details like these that make sets stand out!</p>
                <p>10370 Poinsettia is a great example of what makes the Botanical line so popular. It’s a fun build with a handful of interesting techniques. Yes, half of the build is essentially the same thing three times over - but it doesn’t feel like a drag. It’s a great - and, at $50, cheap - source of unusual re-colors. And of course, it’s a beautiful display piece. I know Christmas is still a ways away, but if you’re looking for a unique take on the festive gift, this would make a great choice. Then again, I would say it’s worth picking up at any time of year!</p>
