                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>10342 Pretty Pink Flower Bouquet is the fourth bouquet in the popular botanical collection. It contains an assortment of 15 flower and foliage stems which, despite the set's name, are not all pink. Most of the varieties are appearing in brick-built form for the first time, but a couple of old favourites have been re-coloured and/or redesigned. The set contains ten different varieties, most in shades of pink or white, but also two extremely vibrant orange heads that look a bit out of place to me.</p>
                <p>10313 Wildflower Bouquet contains blue and white cornflowers and those here are constructed in the same way, but with dark green stems, white petals and pink stamens. One stem comprises two heads and a bud, the other of a single head. Eucalyptus is also a part of this set. Specifically, Eucalyptus pulverulenta, or blue-leafed mountain gum, which is endemic to New South Wales. Cuttings of cultivated examples are often used in bouquets to give them volume and colour. Here, round 2x2 sand green tiles are clipped to two of the new curved 3.2 shafts with cross-axles and from the front it looks very effective, but a bit messy from behind.</p>
                <p>The Elder flowers add a bit of green to this bouquet. Elder flowers are the source of a popular flavouring for drinks particularly, and the two cuttings of the tree here look wonderful. Both have flowers and berries: I'm not sure how realistic that is, given that one follows the other, but their different colours, textures and shapes certainly add interest to them, as do the dark grey branches.</p>
                <p>An important part of this set is the pink roses. I believe these are the sixth iteration of rose to have appeared in botanical sets and their revised design is definitely the best yet. They are the first pink ones, and they make use of the same combination of wheel arch and shell as one design found in 10328 Bouquet of Roses, but this time the shells are offset by half a stud, so they interleave more closely and look much better as a result.</p>
                <p>The blue daisies help fluff up the bouquet. Botanical sets have largely made use of existing pieces to recreate life-sized brick-built plants and that is part of their appeal. This year, though, several new elements have been introduced, including the light blue flower head piece used for these daisies. A yellow one can also be found in the dandelion in 30701 Field Flowers, which we reviewed recently.</p>
                <p>Canterbury bells add white to this set in an elegant way. Two new pieces are used here: an 'inverted bell' for the smaller flower heads, and a new type of three-pronged stalk which has 3.18 bars rather than the thin stems. I haven't added pictures of them here, partly because New Elementary has already done a fantastic job of photographing them and exploring their potential, so check out the article over there if you'd like more information.</p>
                <p>The Persian buttercups are beautiful but don't look like they belong compared to some of the other flowers. These definitely win the award for best parts usage in the set: each head comprises 30 axe heads in reddish orange and orange clipped to a steering wheel and an octagonal ring. I found it quite fiddly interleaving them in the way shown in the instructions, but I guess ultimately it doesn't matter whether they are constructed exactly as shown or not, given flowers are organic structures with natural variety. They are undoubtedly vibrant and very attractive but, nevertheless, I think they look out of place in the otherwise pink bouquet.</p>
                <p>The waterlily dahlia uses minifig shields that almost look as if they were designed to be used as petals, and the 24 light nougat ones here give this impressive bloom a lovely shape and texture. Like the buttercup, it was fiddly to clip them equally spaced around the two steering wheels and angled into a pleasing shape, but with perseverance the end result looks magnificent.</p>
                <p>Last but certainly not least are the Cymbidiums, or boat orchids, whose deep colour and size dominate the bouquet. The petals are the fourth new element in the set, and they look versatile enough to be used as petals, leaves and maybe even as tree canopies at minifig scale. There is a lot going on inside the head to form the various parts of the flower: the white frog for the column, boat studs for the caps, and the white 1-wide and dark red 2-wide ferns at the bottom for the lip. It looks magnificent!</p>
                <p>The heavy heads cause the stems to bow slightly and roll until the flower 'droops' to wherever gravity wants it to be. I therefore found it difficult to arrange them all pleasingly. I suspect a chunk of horticultural foam at the bottom of the vase to stick the stems in would help immensely, although I've heard conflicting views whether it reacts with LEGO pieces over time or not. These are not problems unique to this bouquet, but the increased size and weight of many of the blooms has exacerbated them.</p>
                <p>Although I have concluded that the entire bunch is somewhat difficult to arrange altogether, and the orange blooms don't go well with the others, the individual flowers are all spectacular. They incorporate nice parts usage and new techniques, and every one of them showcases the versatility of LEGO and how parts designed for one thing can also be used for something entirely different. If you have any of the other bouquets, you'll enjoy mixing and matching them together, perhaps putting the buttercups with others of a similar hue, and splitting the remainder of these into two or more vases. LEGO can do no wrong with the botanical collection, and I can't even complain about the price because this bouquet is the same as the first, $59.99 for a similar number of pieces.</p>
