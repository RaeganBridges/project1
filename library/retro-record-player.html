                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>LEGO Insiders Weekend 2024 had plenty of GWPs (gift with purchase), discounts and offers, and the big drawcard is the 40699 Retro Record Player GWP, a delightful ode to fans of vinyl and records! Here's a quick review of the set to give you an idea of what to expect! It does come with a hefty redemption threshold, and you needed to spend $250 or more on LEGO.com from 23-24 November 2024, making it one of the most expensive GWPs of 2024 that isn't tied to a specific set purchase.</p>
                <p>The high purchase threshold is quite unfortunate, as this is one of the best GWPs of 2024, and will likely appeal to a wide number of people, making this one of the strongest arguments for a “GWP that should've been a retail set”. The model is quite large, measuring over 1.5 in. (4cm) high, 6 in. (16 cm) wide and 4.5 in. (12 cm) deep. It's definitely not as big as a full-sized real-life record player, but think of this as a miniaturised LEGO model. The build is quite fun, spread out across 4 bags, and it's quite an engaging build. Bags 1-3 build the Record Player, and Bag 4 builds the record.</p>
                <p>The transparent dust cover which is made out of uncommon clear panels, including the curved ones easily opens and closes. There are some nice features such as a power button on the left, which can be nudged into the on or off position. On the other side is a volume knob, as well as a slider to control the speed of the record. The needle can swivel to scratch the record, and when unused can be tucked in neatly into position with the little antenna piece. The record is affixed onto some splat gears which allows the records to be spun!</p>
                <p>The back features a clandestine grey splat gear that is used to spin the record, which works quite well. I also really like the red, white and grey ports on the back, which represent the Right and Left channel, and presumably a Ground (Grey) for a cable to an amp.The record was also a really fun build. It has a diameter of just under 4 inches, so you could pretend that it's a novelty mini record which are usually about 3 inches across.</p>
                <p>The biggest surprise of the set is that every single element is printed! In fact, 40699 Retro Record Player debuts these new printed elements with musical elements such as notes and equaliser bars on them. These printed elements definitely enhance the vinyl record's appearance, and I can't quite remember if LEGO has ever used a gift with purchase to debut new printed elements! For music fans, and LEGO enthusiasts who enjoy building and collecting old pieces of technology, 40699 Retro Record Player is a fun addition to the collection, which includes the likes of sets like 10334 Retro Radio, Creator 31147 Retro Camera, 21327 Typewriter and the 21345 Polaroid OneStep SX-70 Camera.</p>
                <p>I really like 40699 Retro Record Player as a set, and it's a real shame that this isn't an actual set that fans can buy. LEGO could've easily sold this for $29.99 as a Creator set, and it would fly off the shelves. This is especially true if you're the type of person who has a deep appreciation for retro technology, or are an active collector of vinyl, and have a sweet record player or sound system setup yourself!</p>
