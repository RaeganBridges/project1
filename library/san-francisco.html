                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Like the first European settlers, LEGO's Architecture Skyline series has been working its way westwards across the North American continent and has now reached the west coast. 21043 San Francisco is the tenth in the series and might just be my favourite. The back lists the structures that are included in the model which are, from left to right, the 'painted ladies', 555 California St., Transamerica Pyramid, Salesforce Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz island. Coit Tower and Fort Point are also modelled, but not labelled. The set's 565 parts are packaged in numbered bags, which is not normally the case for Architecture sets.</p>
                <p>Salesforce Tower is the first building to be erected. Parts in bag #2 complete the three named skyscrapers and also several others in front of them. The white Transamerica pyramid consists of tiles mounted vertically and two 2x8 spikes either side: a simple but surprisingly effective way of capturing the distinctive outline of the building. It's uncommon to find printed pieces used to depict details such as windows in Architecture sets - they are usually implied using other methods - but here printed 1x2 bricks have been used on the Alcatraz island buildings, and one of the smaller skyscrapers. San Francisco is known for its hills and steep roads so this microscale depiction rightfully includes landscaping. Once the painted ladies and other smaller structures have been added to the scene, the bridge is built to complete the model.</p>
                <p>What's particularly interesting about it is the way forced perspective has been used for the bridge. Given that most people will see the the real bridge with a view such as this it makes perfect sense to do it that way, not to mention that to model it to scale would require a base quite a lot longer than 36 studs! The cables have been formed using flex-tube which I believe appears here in dark red for the first time. The towers have been modelled as if looking at them head-on rather than from the side. The road goes behind the near tower and in front of the far, not between the sides of them as you would expect. Despite all this, it seems to work!</p>
                <p>The downtown San Francisco area looks fantastic and unlike any other Skyline set, thanks to the landscaping and additional buildings that have been included which make it more like a model of an actual place rather than a collection of buildings, although I understand that in reality the structures are nowhere near each other. Alcatraz island is certainly nowhere near the bridge: that would make escaping far too easy! The painted ladies look tiny against the skyscrapers behind, as indeed they should. Colourful cable cars traverse the steep road behind them. The white 1x1 plates with black square printed on one side, used to good effect in the painted ladies, first appeared in this year's Ninjago sets, I believe.</p>
                <p>The landscaping, additional buildings and the clever perspective of the bridge set this skyline apart from others in the series. Often they look look like the structures have been plonked on the base somewhat randomly but that's not the case here. I've never been to SF and don't know the significance of most of the buildings but I still feel that the spirit of the city - its steep roads, colourful old houses, modern architecture, and of course that bridge -- has been captured superbly. In fact, it makes me want to visit, so from that regard it's a successful model!</p>
