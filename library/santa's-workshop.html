                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Earlier in December 2022, the LEGO Group released a Christmas-themed gift-with-purchase (GWP). Santa’s Workshop (40565), as the name suggests, features old Kris Kringle’s gift-making space. Interestingly, LEGO designers made the set to connect with the Black Friday Winter Elves Scene and Santa’s Front Yard, from 2022 and 2021 respectively.</p>
                <p>Santa’s Workshop was supposed to be free with purchases over $190 from December 1 until December 24, 2022. However, stocks ran out sometime between December 9 and 16. There was a double VIP points event from December 9 - 13 which probably played a role. You can’t beat free bricks, and we’d all make the purchase anyway. Might as well get something extra with it. I was pleasantly surprised with how long this set took me, and again, it was free building time.</p>
                <p>Santa’s Workshop features a small diorama scene of a red barn-like building. Inside the sliding doors, you find a small workstation and a conveyor belt for loading presents into Santa’s sleigh. Additionally, a computer terminal shows a present delivery plan of the world centered from the North Pole departure point. It’s really cute.</p>
                <p>I have a couple of small issues with the design though. Firstly, the doors slide too much. The design does not include a stopper to prevent the doors from sliding past the center point. Thankfully, they can’t slide off the tracks. However, each door can slide into the position of the other. Secondly, the roof does not extend to the peak of the structure. I’m not looking for a complete building with a freebie set. But getting at least half of one would be nice. Again, it’s a cute build. However, feels a little incomplete.</p>
                <p>Santa’s Workshop comes with two Minifigures. The elf included in the set has stumpy, unmoving legs. Right off the bat, I wish it had the short, moving legs instead. Otherwise, both have front and back torso printing. However, neither has a double-sided face. I do like Santa’s dual-molded legs though. In terms of accessories, the characters include a video game controller, a couple of micro-figs, a lantern, and a couple of paint brushes.</p>
                <p>Santa’s Workshop is a typical holiday GWP. It’s fun to display for the season. It’s a cute little shelf display for Christmas, and that’s about it. Unlike many other GWPs, I would not rate Santa’s Workshop (40565) lower if I had actually paid for it. So, Santa’s Workshop is a good set overall. Would I buy this set? Probably not. It is not complete enough as a design. However, as a freebie, I like it. It’s a nice holiday display piece, and free bricks for other builds later.</p>
