                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Let me be blunt, LEGO provided one of the 31158 Sea Animals sets for review, but before even cracking open the box I felt a strong need to buy two more of them. So, yes, I like it a lot. This adorable little set provides excellent value for money with 421 pieces. Ironically, the part that convinced me I needed more than one of these sets was the back of the box. The back of the box shows the three alternative builds in a way that hints that they will go well together in a single display. So I was hooked to get more fish.</p>
                <p>Each of the individual builds by themselves provide neat build techniques, vibrant colours and a great variation of different undersea animals. I don't know if I have a preference for any of the alternative builds, but the hero build supposedly is the turtle and friends. This build seems to have strongly been inspired by a Finding Nemo, with a Yellow Tang (Bubbles), a sea turtle (Crush), a Moorish Idol (Gill), a sea horse (Sheldon), and jellyfish.</p>
                <p>The second build is a bit more original showing a squid and a cuttlefish with some rocks and plants. The eyes make them cartoonish and adorable and again the colours really pop. The final builds goes a bit more wild with both plants, rocks and fish design. I think the fish may be a Striped Damselfish (Deb) and an exotic looking Goldfish with the white-pink-red-yellow colour pallet.</p>
                <p>Each of these builds by themselves are nice, but when you put them together you are presented with a well populated aquarium. You'll notice that each of the bases of the fish comes with clips to allow you to connect them together in any sequence you like. These sets come with a considerable variety of pieces and after building all the the instructions quite a few pieces are left. After seeing all these animals appear in my hands, I was very tempted to build my own creatures to add to the already crowded display, and there was plenty of opportunity to do so with the parts that were left in the end.</p>
                <p>There is one issue that irked me a bit when building these adorable creatures and it has to do with their tails. Cetaceans have evolved from creatures who decided that land-life wasn't for them and they moved back into the sea. One key element is that their spine and muscular structure is well developed for vertical bending (much like land dwelling creatures such as ourselves). As such, they move their tail up and down to power their swimming. Other fish have developed a spine that is good at sideways movement and their predominantly move their tails sideways. When we look at these LEGO builds we see that only the goldfish is able to move their tail sideways, where al other scan only move their tail up and down.</p>
                <p>It has been clear I have loved building these sets. Stimulated by the one seed set provided by LEGO, my opinion is clearly expressed by me purchasing another 4 sets (3 designs) to extend the experience. I didn't think I had any particular attraction to fish, but I do like animals in general and it turns out that the colourful nature of the undersea world provided me with much joy.</p>
