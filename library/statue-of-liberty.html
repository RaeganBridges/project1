                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The Statue of Liberty is perhaps the most recognizable American icon and has been rendered in LEGO bricks many times. From a massive version towering over the original LEGOLAND Billund to a much-sought-after collectible minifigure variant, Lady Liberty is a longstanding favorite of LEGO designers. The newest addition to the LEGO Architecture line 21042 Statue of Liberty is arguably the most complex, accurate and satisfying renditions, containing 1,685 pieces and available now for $119.99.</p>
                <p>As with other LEGO Architecture sets, 21042 Statue of Liberty comes in a premium storage box with a decent heft to it, but oriented vertically and towering over any other box from the Architecture line so far. While the series has typically been targeted at a building age of 12+, the Statue of Liberty indicated a building suggestion of 16+, already suggesting that it will be a more complex build.</p>
                <p>Opening the box reveals ten numbered bags full of tan, sand green, and some red white and blue elements as well as three loose red Technic axle links. Architecture sets haven't typically had numbered bags, so their inclusion is a welcome change to avoid spending the majority of your building time looking for that one part. A perfect-bound 183-page instruction booklet rounds out the box contents, which includes a brief history about the statue as well as some glamor shots, though interestingly the text is only in English rather than repeated in several different languages like former booklets have done.</p>
                <p>The actual build process starts simply with a square base and four walls built from tan masonry profile bricks. From there, red, white and blue elements (a dose of internal patriotism) are used to create a structure to attach what essentially is an outward facing façade of tan details. Several previous LEGO versions have opted to exclude the pedestal, likely for height considerations. However, that's where the simplicity of the set ends.</p>
                <p>I would almost describe the process of building this set as creating numerous “puzzle pieces,” then assembling those sub-builds to reveal the completed model. Though somewhat repetitive in creating nearly four identical copies of each segment for each of the four sides of the statue, the segments themselves are incredibly detailed. Boat studs are used to represent the circular panels wrapped around the base of the pedestal, and several more “puzzle pieces” are created, adding texture and patterns to flush out the first half of the base.</p>
                <p>The central core of the pedestal is hollow, allowing for several flexible Technic 16L axle links to essentially anchor the upcoming top portion of the build. These links act as tension cables that allow for the completed model to be lifted without worrying that the statue will fall off the pedestal. The rest of the build feels even more like a puzzle as subassemblies are created to wrap around the exterior of the central column and reveal Lady Liberty. Each of the sub-builds are fairly easy, though since everything is sand green it is easy to accidentally use the wrong part. (As an aside, I consider myself to be a fairly decent LEGO builder, and I still made three mistakes confusing the different baby wedge bows which I had to search for and then correct when I ran out of the elements later on. Quite humbling!)</p>
                <p>Lady Liberty's right arm is connected using an incredibly simple, yet satisfying technique that I won't spoil here, but rest assured it takes advantage of the geometry of a few pieces to perfectly secure the upright arm in place. The torch's flame is a recolored version of Salazar's black windswept hairpiece from last year's 71042 Silent Mary. Molded in pearl gold, it catches the light and works remarkably well to represent the flame capping off the Statue of Liberty.</p>
                <p>Finally, the statue's crown and face are created out of all new elements in sand green. The pentagonal Nexo Knight shield is used as the face of Lady Liberty. This gives the her an extremely abstract and flat-looking face from close up, though in the proper shape. The model is certainly meant to be viewed from a distance for the right effect. I talked to set designer Rok Žgalin Kobe in Billund about the choice, and he said that they tried many different prints and brick-built renditions, but that the simplest version ended up being the most effective, short of creating a molded face.</p>
                <p>Altogether, the puzzle that is 21042 Statue of Liberty is a particularly challenging build with a stunning result. In comparison to LEGO's previous sand green, nearly 3,000 piece 3450 Statue of Liberty from 18 years ago, the current Architecture version is sleek and feels more complete with the pedestal included. In terms of size, the earlier version dwarfs her sand green sisters, but the use of curved elements makes the pleats in the robes on the statue more identifiable.</p>
                <p>Having lived in New York City for a fair number of years, I have often gazed at the Statue of Liberty across the water from downtown. Whenever friends or family would visit, we would venture out to Liberty Island to climb to the crown inside the statue and back down. Being so close to the base of Lady Liberty, we would look up at the symbol of freedom and collectively feel like we were part of something bigger than ourselves. Building this LEGO version, even with its complexities, brought back a hint of those feelings, which is remarkable for a toy made of plastic bricks.</p>
