                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>The increasing size and ambition of LEGO Ideas sets provides an opportunity for some stunning designs, although smaller creations can achieve superb results as well. 21340 Tales of the Space Age shows this potential and looks incredible in official images! Few changes have been introduced, relative to the original project, other than the addition of another picture. The unique style presented by Jan's creation therefore remains intact and the price of $49.99 is also quite affordable, so this should prove impressive.</p>
                <p>There seems to be little consistency regarding which Ideas sets are packaged in boxes with flaps, as 21340 Tales of the Space Age includes a standard box. Nevertheless, the four images look splendid and I like the teal border. Inside are eight numbered bags and five instruction manuals, so as many as four people can build simultaneously. The fifth booklet contains information about the celestial phenomena depicted, as well as the fan designer, Jan Woznica.</p>
                <p>Each image measures nearly 15cm in height and 9cm across, so they are relatively small and easy to display. Additionally, these little models have surprising presence, benefiting from their bold colours and distinctive style, which is inspired by retro posters. Their shared features also ensure the images look nice when presented together. Technic pin holes are available on the sides of each image, providing connection points between them. Three pins are perhaps excessive, but certainly provide a secure connection. These joints are perfectly hidden too, behind the front layer of bricks, which leaves enough space for Technic supports and hanger elements across the back. The four models look fantastic when combined, as their layers of colour line up neatly, but cover a spectrum of shades. The addition of green tones beneath the black hole is effective and I like how the colours of the foregrounds differ too, which is a minor change from Jan's design. Even though this configuration is attractive, I actually prefer to display them separated.</p>
                <p>Technic beams reinforce the images, which are only one or two bricks deep. Their bright colours remain visible though and the structures are finished quite nicely, even from behind. Also, the designer has also included a couple of unexpected red and white plates on the first and last models, representing the Polish flag and Jan's home country. Beyond the inclusion of an entirely new picture, the most noticeable alterations from the original project have been applied to this image, which the instructions describe as depicting comets. Comet groups are believed to exist, but I think this more closely resembles a meteor shower. Regardless, rather than descending from the top of the image, these objects are now travelling sideways, while the white base has been replaced with dark blue.</p>
                <p>I appreciate the latter change, which complements the shadowy radio telescope receivers on the ground, while the orientation of the meteors could easily be changed if you wish. Whatever their direction, I like the flame yellowish orange glow around the closest object, while those more distant are represented by white wands, attached using 1x1 clips. Whereas the first image is presumably based on Earth, the second seems more alien. The dark orange and reddish brown colours are immediately reminiscent of Mars, but the gigantic moons in the sky are nothing like Deimos and Phobos. The barren landscape is attractive and I love the tiny rover, overwhelmed by its environment, although leaving an imprint by smoothing the terrain as it travels.</p>
                <p>However, the most appealing features are undoubtedly the moons, partly illuminated or even eclipsed by the planet. Stacking 8x8 round tiles with four studs and 2x2 round tiles is very successful, especially since the light bluish grey pieces clearly stand out against the dark backdrop. In addition, depending on the light source, the uppermost elements cast a shadow, which only makes the moons seem more realistic!</p>
                <p>The most dynamic of these four images is definitely the rocket launch. The billowing clouds are absolutely brilliant, either representing smoke around the launchpad, or disrupted clouds where the rocket has burst through. The combination of round tiles, dishes and 2x2 sliders is wonderful and I like the gentle curvature of the 1x10 bow extending beneath the spacecraft. Unfortunately, the direction of the rocket plume can be disrupted slightly, as it is only supported by a single clip. Even so, the model looks lovely and includes several printed stars to recreate constellations. Ursa Major, commonly known as the Plough or the Big Dipper, is presented on the box and above, while Ursa Minor appears below. Instructions for Cassiopeia and Cepheus are also provided, but the lack of Southern Hemisphere constellations is disappointing.</p>
                <p>The fourth image was suggested by LEGO, although developed with direction from Jan, so the style remains identical. This green atmosphere looks completely alien and provides a beautiful backdrop for the silhouetted landscape, featuring a couple of odd buildings atop a hill. Perhaps these denote a long-abandoned civilisation, whose people fled in anticipation of the approaching black hole. Depictions of black holes differ between sources. This example looks marvellous and recalls the collapsed star from Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, featuring a spring yellowish green accretion disk, visually distorted through gravitational lensing. A pair of lime green 2x2 curved corner tiles nicely represent bands of matter gathered around the black hole. However, I think angling the accretion disk appears more natural and is possible with only minor modification, by adding a 2x2 jumper plate behind the black hole. The below design looks much better to me, so I am surprised the designer instead decided to position this stellar phenomenon horizontally.</p>
                <p>Enjoyable though sets like 21336 The Office or 21338 A-Frame Cabin can be, 21340 Tales of the Space Age represents the essence of LEGO Ideas, in my opinion. The concept is unusual and possesses a visual character which would typically be limited to fan creations. Fortunately, this set is available to everyone and looks incredible! While their construction is inevitably repetitive, these four images feature spectacular colour and are ideal for display. Their presence is remarkable, considering their modest size. In addition, I think the price of $49.99 represents reasonable value, so I would recommend this creative addition to the LEGO Ideas range with no hesitation.</p>
