                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>LEGO One Piece, a brand new theme based on the Netflix adaptation of the long-running anime and manga sets sail into your LEGO collection on 1 August 2025, and to kick off our reviews, I'm starting with 75639 The Going Merry Pirate Ship, the flagship of the set. It's not the biggest LEGO One Piece set (that honour goes to the 18+ 75640 The Baratie Floating Restaurant), BUT, the Going Merry is such an iconic ship crewed by the Straw Hat Pirates that this is going to be the most popular and sought-after set in the theme.</p>
                <p>Fair warning, I have not watched the Netflix series yet, but I did grow up reading the manga, and also watching the anime, so I'm pretty familiar with the source material, but not the modern Netflix adaptation.. That said, I'm not up to date… and stopped at about the Water 7 sage, so yes, I am more than a decade behind. One Piece is the brainchild of Eiichiro Oda and has been going on since 1999, which is a truly remarkable feat, and is one of the most influential manga series out of Japan, so as a fairly big fan of manga and anime, I think it's a huge deal for LEGO to finally embrace the medium, even if its through a Netflix series. 75639 The Going Merry Pirate Ship  releases on 1 August 2025 worldwide, so let's set sail and see if the set is the treasure LEGO One Piece fans seek! </p>
                <p>The build was very enjoyable for a 1,376-piece model. There are 10 numbered bags in total, so it doesn't take too long to get through it, and the most surprising thing for me is that the Going Merry doesn't rely on large specialised hull elements, which is a pretty impressive feat. Another highlight of the set are the new sails and flags. These are made out of plastic, but they're much thicker than typical foil elements, and they have a matte finish to them which makes them feel very nice to the touch.</p>
                <p>75639 The Going Merry Pirate Ship comes with 5 minifigures, all of whom are key crew members of the Straw Hats, and fan-favourites. We get Nami, Monkey D Luffy, Usopp, Sanji and Roronoa Zoro, who all look great. As a fan of the manga/anime, these figures are excellent renditions of your favourite One Piece characters, and while yes, these are technically based on the Netflix series, they do look cartoonish enough to pass as manga characters thanks to their distinctive looks, which the graphic designers at LEGO have done a fantastic job adapting.</p>
                <p>First up we have Monkey D Luffy, series protagonist and strongest member of the Straw Hats. His minifigure doesn't quite have the silly anime look, so leans more towards the live-action version, but key elements such as his outfit, and iconic Straw Hat, a gift from legendary pirate Shanks make him instantly recognisable as a minifigure. Monkey D Luffy is fearless, always hungry and possess the power to turn his body into rubber, after consuming the Gomu Gomu no Mi which gives him unparalleled flexibility. The new Monkey D Luffy Straw Hat is also done really well, with hair fused into it, as well as fine textural lines that go across the brim. LEGO Monkey D Luffy looks great, and one Piece fans will be incredibly happy to get their hands on this minifigure. 75639 The Going Merry Pirate Ship is also ironically, the cheapest set to get Luffy in his Straw hat as the other smaller sets only have him in his regular hair, so it does make this variant pretty special.</p>
                <p>Up next we have Nami, the navigator of the Straw Hats who was initially reluctant to join Luffy's crew and even betrays them at one point, before having her freedom redeemed by the Luffy and his crew, eventually leading her to become a member of the crew. Nami looks fantastic, I love her new wig which does a great job capturing her shorter hairstyle from the earlier seasons, and her blue striped top also looks great. The details on her legs are printed, instead of being dual-moulded which is a bit of a shame, but the print and colour matching are pretty good. Just don't look at it from the side or back, as it breaks the illusion slightly.</p>
                <p>Next we have Usopp, and I'm really glad LEGO recoloured the slingshot in green to represent his Ginga Pachinko. In the manga/anime, Usopp does some epic stuff with his slingshot, and its wild array of projectiles fired, and One Piece fans will be really happy to see him here. Usopp's minifigure is fantastic, with a high level of printing across his torso and legs, but the highlight would have to be his new kerchief, which has dreadlocks fused to it, and a really nice knot at the back. As a One Piece manga/anime fan, this doesn't really look like Usopp to me, as it lacks his beady little eyes and crazy expression, but looking at the Netflix source material, it's a really good adaptation of the live-action version.</p>
                <p>Here we have Sanji, who used to be a chef working at the Baratie, under the tutelage of Zeff. He's in his signature black suit, and sports a brand new wig as well, which looks fantastic, really capturing Sanji's blonde hair. Sanji is the Going Merry's cook, and has a deadly fighting style involving kicks, and also dreams to find the All Blue, which contains all the fish in the world, including never before seen fish. And yes, you can also swivel it to block his eye to nail his look. Sanj is exclusive to this set, so One Piece fans are definitely going to need to add this set to their collection, which is really a redundant thing to say as the Going Merry is going to sell like hotcakes.</p>
                <p>And last but certainly not least, we have Roronoa Zoro, who aspires to be the greatest swordsman ever. He employs the Three Sword fighting style with a sword in his mouth. Zoro's mouth sword is Wado Ichimonji, and its a brand new mould, loosely based on the LEGO katana sword, with a notch that goes in between the minifigure's head and torso. I'm just so impressed at how deeply they committed with this. I also like his new kerchief. I wonder where we'll see this very piratey headgear show up again. Roronoa Zoro is exclusive to The Going Merry ship, and done so remarkably well, that he's the big drawcard for LEGO One Piece fans. You cannot have a LEGO One Piece collection without Roronoa Zoro, so by that virtue alone, it's a must-have for fans.</p>
                <p>The minifigures included in 75639 The Going Merry Pirate Ship are nothing short of sensational, and One Piece fans will be delighted with how most of them look. Whether you're introduced to One Piece through the live-action Netflix series, or a long-time fan of the anime/manga, it still really does feel like a pinch-me moment to have these One Piece minifigures in the flesh. LEGO have outdone themselves with the Going Merry Pirate ship. The model is decently sized, measuring approximately 13.5 in. (34 cm) tall, and 15.5 in. (39 cm) long.</p>
                <p>I love that the ship is entirely brick-built, and that the design team didn't need to resort to large hull elements, which does make the model feel quite “pure” from a LEGO building perspective. The absolutely massive sail with the Straw Hats jolly roger emblem is what ties the entire model together, and just looks so incredibly good. The print is really high definition, and the matte material also cuts down on reflectiveness, and its semi-rigid properties also gives it a good shape. There's a crow's nest for Usopp, and you can also see the smaller jolly roger flags on both masts.</p>
                <p>In the anime/manga, the Going Merry has a woolly sheep theme to it, and looks quite silly (like most things in the One Piece universe), but in the live action, the figurehead is based on a more realistic sheep, which is reflected in the design of the set. It still looks great, and was a blast to build. Right below the figurehead is a stud shooter meant to represent a cannon. You can press down on a cone element at the top to fire the 1x1 round tile, which is pretty clever, but I would've liked a proper LEGO cannon here, mostly for aesthetics, even though the Straw Hats really don't resort to their cannons much.</p>
                <p>The design team has definitely made great use of space in the front, you can lift up a plate, to reveal some quarters below deck. There's some nice decorative elements, including a bed/hammock inside, along with some stickered decorations like rope, and also a porthole. What's really impressive, hower is the back section, which pulls apart really easily. No clips are used here, it's all friction that keeps everything intact which demonstrates very advanced building techniques here that work so well.</p>
                <p>This back section also swivels open to reveal some treasure and accessories. At the back we have the kitchen and the crew lounge. The sofa section is quite cramped, but works well as a visual element, with space instead devoted to the kitchen. There's a slice of pizza, which is a nod to Luffy's favourite food - a New York-style pepperoni pizza! But wait, there's more! The deck is quite large, with enough space to fit all the minifigures in the set comfortably, which is always a good thing, but there's also enough space if you also want to have the Going Merry boarded by enemies to fight!</p>
                <p>Lifting up another plate reveals another secret compartment for a hidden food stash! This double crate system can be lifted out for easy access too. There's a variety of food items, but One Piece fans will also be delighted to find these printed 2x3 bounty posters, which are a signature part of the anime/manga. Only the most notorious and most-wanted pirates get a bounty put on their head, and their power levels/notoriety are directly correlated to the size of their bounty - hence why Monkey D Luffy's bounty is the highest!</p>
                <p>The Going Merry is one of the most iconic fictional Pirate Ships in pop culture, and I think it looks fantastic alongside some of LEGO's best pirate ships from year's past. As someone that grew up on One Piece, 75639 The Going Merry Pirate Ship is a dream come true, its translated so well into LEGO form. Whether you're a fan of the anime or a new live-action One Piece convert, the Going Merry is faithfully brought to life, with most of its most well-known features, especially the sails with the Straw Hat pirates logo executed perfectly. Add in a spectacular cast of minifigures, especially the two exclusives, Roronoa Zoro and Sanji, as well as the rare Luffy with Straw Hat and you have a winning lineup that will make One Piece fans who make the investment very happy.</p> 
                <p>When you factor all this into an engaging build that looks great on display, I feel like the $139.99 represents great value, especially when you consider the large and typically pricey sails, and the plethora of new minifigure elements introduced. With One Piece having such a huge fanbase, and the recent Netflix live-action introducing the property to so many new fans. 75639 The Going Merry Pirate Ship is a dream come true for One Piece fans, and at the same time, makes for a great LEGO Pirate ship in its own right that will slot right into any LEGO Pirates collection.</p>
