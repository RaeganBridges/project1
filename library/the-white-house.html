                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>I've had 21054 The White House for a few months now and to be honest I was not looking forward to building it, fearing it would be a fiddly and time-consuming job like 21030 United States Capitol Building was. However, I needn't have worried because it's actually one of the best Architecture building experiences I've had.</p>
                <p>This is the first Architecture set to be packaged in a new 18+ style box, which is larger than I was expecting. It's still the sturdy flip-top lid variety, though, so can be opened without destroying it. The four-floor central mansion, which was built in 1812 and rebuilt 5 years later after being set on fire by the British, is constructed first. The front and back are built entirely studs-on-side and, while there is some lining up of 1x1 pieces required, it's not nearly as bad as I was anticipating. 1x2 plates with rails mounted vertically are used extensively throughout the building to represent pillars between the windows. The internal structure in all three sections of the building is made from blue and red pieces, the colours of the US flag, of course, but also the political colours of the Republicans and Democrats.</p>
                <p>It's built as a separate sub-assembly which looks pretty good on its own, and could feasibly be displayed stand-alone, perhaps next to 21006 The White House from 2010 which only consisted of this part of the building. I'd have done so myself to photograph but I've not yet built the older model, and probably never will now. The north portico is a bit awkward to construct, requiring lining up all the pillars with the 1x1 'polo' plates on the roof. The east wing, which was added in 1942 primarily to cover the construction of an underground bunker, is built next, although early versions of the instruction manual, the one I have, erroneously calls it the west wing, which confused me somewhat. This has been corrected in the current version.</p>
                <p>Once again, most of the exterior walls are built studs-on-side and the entire corridor is built on its side. They utilise mostly 1x2 pieces. Neat lines of bushes and a couple of trees make up Kennedy garden at the front. The bushes are made with the very useful and versatile 1x2 plate with rounded ends, which is new this year in green. The west wing, which includes the President's Oval Office at the front, is where the business of government is conducted.</p>
                <p>The pillars of the external portico/walkway are made using 1x2 plates with bar. Window arches, and a window arch corner piece, which is unique to this set in white, are used on the back wall of the corridor which houses a swimming pool and press briefing rooms. The wings are attached to the central section with just a few studs which makes it easy to do and undo, but also difficult to move it in one piece. Overall it's about 48cm wide and 20cm deep and, just like the real building, looks very elegant, with whitewashed walls and manicured gardens.</p>
                <p>Another great thing about its modularity is that it fits in the box without the need to disassemble it. I wish more Architecture sets were like this! I was pleasantly surprised by this set. It wasn't the fiddly build I was anticipating and the completed model looks well-proportioned and accurate. A range of interesting techniques have been utilised to replicate the building's elegant details at a small scale and micro-scale builders may well learn a thing or two from it. I really like the fact it's modular because, not only does is make it easier and more enjoyable to build, but also much easier to store when you need to pack it away to make way for something new.</p>
