                        <h3>Biography</h3>
                        <p>The world's most famous ship, whose very name conjures up images of its massive significance in history, is LEGO's newest foray into the seas of adult collector pieces. Having the most parts of any movie model set ever made, Titanic 10294 is over 4 feet in length and with 9,090 pieces, and considered as the longest traditional LEGO model in history.</p>
                        <p>Legendary Danish toymaker Lego released this super-detailed model of the Titanic and it is suitable for display and build experts, providing a fun and challenging building experience, while also honoring the ship's incredible history.</p>
                        <p>On April 10, 1912, the Titanic left Southampton, England, on her maiden voyage to New York City as the largest and most luxurious ocean liner in the world. Although it had been declared "unsinkable," the ship met a tragic end on April 14, 1912, when it ran into an iceberg in the North Atlantic. One of the biggest maritime tragedies in history, the disaster claimed almost 1,500 lives. There have been innumerable books, movies, and tributes created because of the Titanic's narrative.</p>
                        <p>The set's deck areas are painstakingly crafted to resemble the Titanic layout in every detail. The ship's cargo cranes, lifeboats, and other deck equipment are all included, allowing builders to fully appreciate the vessel's massive size and meticulous design. However historians may be bothered by the tiny differences between this model and the actual ship's layout.</p>
                        <p>The hull of the Lego Titanic sets is a technical masterpiece, utilizing cutting-edge construction methods to accurately represent the ship's distinctive profile. Intricacies in the hull's construction, such as the utilization of curved parts to produce the vessel's shapes and the meticulous arrangement of tiles for a seamless appearance, will be appreciated by builders throughout the assembly process.</p>
                        <p>All four of the Titanic's recognizable funnels can be seen in the LEGO® Titanic set, and each one is a faithful recreation of the originals. The set's intricate masts, rigging, and crow's nests lend an extra level of realism to the model, complementing the funnels.</p>
                        <p>Building this model should be able to help you visualize the ship's size. In addition, you can only think about the passengers' mental states from the time they boarded until the ship sank and, for a lucky few that got rescued. There will be snippets of trivia scattered throughout the manuals that can prompt some very thought-provoking reflections.</p>
