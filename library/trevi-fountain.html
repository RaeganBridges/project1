                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>If you have a chance to check out the #21020 LEGO Architecture Trevi Fountain set in person the first thing you will notice is how heavy the box is. It is surely a largish box for a LEGO Architecture set, but the weight will still surprise you; over 2 pounds of LEGO goodness! This is partially because of the thick and very high quality booklet, and also because of the density of the LEGO model itself. While most LEGO buildings have a certain airiness to them both for facilitating play and also to keep down cost, LEGO Architecture sets (especially the larger ones) are characterized by this heavy, dense building style that aims for realism and for providing interesting building techniques that doesn't skimp on pieces.</p>
                <p>The booklet that comes with the #21020 LEGO Architecture Trevi Fountain is 142 pages long, full color and super slick in black. Of course it includes the building instructions for the actual model, and also a lot about its history of the fountain; details about the design and construction, the architects, as well as the Trevi Fountain in the past and present. It is actually a really interesting read, and the same information is available both in English and Italian (other languages are available at the LEGO Architecture website).</p>
                <p>The Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi) is the most famous and arguably the most beautiful fountain in Rome. This impressive Baroque-styled monument was completed in 1762 and still dominates the small Trevi square located in the city's Quirinale district. Many smaller fountains were constructed between 1400 and 1700, almost all of them at the behest of the reigning pope. It was also Pope Clement XII who organized a competition in 1730 to build a more dramatic fountain. Many of the most renowned architects of the day entered the competition, which architect Nicola Salvi eventually won. There are a lot more interesting details included in the first 10 pages, with some beautiful pictures of the fountain itself.</p>
                <p>Once you admired the booklet and read the back-story of the fountain, of course you would be ready for building it! There are 731 pieces in this set with most of them in white. You also get a great number of trans-blue pieces as well; 34 1x1 bricks, 28 1x1 plates, and 97 1x2 plates. Larger LEGO Architecture sets like the Trevi Fountain take a while to build. It is a very different experience then putting a LEGO set together aimed at children. Here there is a lot more focus on realism and also using more sophisticated building techniques that experienced LEGO fans would appreciate. There is also quite a bit of repetition and putting small pieces together, which could make the building experience boring and painful, however I have never found this to be true with LEGO Architecture sets. Because the final models are not that large in size, whatever repetition is present it is spiced up with unique building techniques and beautiful color combinations that keeps your interest. I don't know how many times I have said out loud “Wow! That was an interesting and clever design!” while building LEGO Architecture sets. So no, LEGO Architecture sets are not tedious or boring.</p>
                <p>The final model of the LEGO Architecture Trevi Fountain is 5 inches (14 cm) tall 7 inches (20 cm) wide and 5 inches (14 cm) deep, so yes, you get a nice size model; not too big, not too small. It stands on a tiled black base with the printed name of the fountain, and the rest of the model is mostly white with trans-blue (a color-combination I always really liked and a characteristic of several LEGO Architecture sets), and some gray for the rocks. LEGO Architecture sets are not so much for play but for display. And they in fact make beautiful show-pieces that look perfectly at home on an office-desk, shelf-space or coffee-table. If you are an architect or designer yourself having a few LEGO Architecture sets displayed in your office is a good way to get clients interested in your work.</p>
                <p>I don't really have anything negative to say about this set. The LEGO Architecture collection is not for everyone, but for those who like them, this is an excellent model. I also thought to mention that the #21018 LEGO Architecture United Nations Headquarters and the #21021 LEGO Architecture Marina Bay Sands has the same color scheme as the LEGO Architecture Trevi Fountain, so if you can display all three of them together you would have a particularly impressive collection.</p>
