                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>On April 23rd, 1946, Enrico Piaggio filed the patent for the first Vespa. Now, over 75 years later, LEGO is celebrating this iconic scooter with a pair of brick-built tributes. The Creator Expert 10298 Vespa set we reviewed yesterday features a powder-blue Vespa 125, while the LEGO Creator 40517 - Vespa Scooter showcases a smaller, more modern version in red. Let's take a ride together and see what this set has to offer!</p>
                <p>This set comes in a small tab-sealed box. The front and back are pretty similar, with a central image of the Vespa seen from either side. It's interesting that there aren't any product shots or teases for any of the other smaller Creator sets, like the 40518 High-Speed Train. Seems like a wasted opportunity.</p>
                <p>Inside the box are two unnumbered parts bags, a staple-bound, 40 page instruction booklet, and a small sticker sheet. The detailing is sticker-based, which is fine for a smaller set like this. The rear license plate has the Vespa logo and “1946” - the year of the Vespa's patent. The front of the scooter also has a sticker-based Vespa logo and a lot of smooth curves created from tile and sloped brick. The floorboards have an interesting connection - they're clipped onto modified 1x1 round plates to create a smooth angle from the front cowling to the rear of the vehicle. There is no steering to be had, though, as the front attaches solidly to the main body with a 5l Technic rod. On the plus side, this fixed front wheel means that the model can sit upright without needing a kick-stand.</p>
                <p>The quote “Sembra una vespa!” (“It looks like a wasp!”) is attributed to Enrico Piaggio's first impression of the scooter's design. That look has carried forward since 1946, as this version of the Vespa has the same antenna-like handlebars and streamlined shape. The scale of this Creator set is great for stand-alone display, but it doesn't mesh all that well with minifigures. Unless you're into hilariously oversized prop vehicles.</p>
                <p>When you compare this model to the Creator Expert 10298 Vespa 125, you can see how the design has evolved over the years. Personally I like the wider cowling of the red scooter, but that powder blue makes me smile just a bit more. Hopefully LEGO will eventually release all the parts from this set in other shades, so fans can create their own hybrid models. If you're looking for a budget version of the 10298 Creator Expert Vespa 125, you're going to be pretty happy with the Creator 40517 version. This updated Vespa stands out with its bright color scheme, realistic detailing, and reasonable sticker usage. The minor downside is that this is more of a display piece than a playable vehicle, as the scale doesn't match up well with any current minifigure offering. But if you're looking for a cute little dust catcher with a lot of character, pick this one up.</p>
