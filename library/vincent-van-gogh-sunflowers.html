                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>LEGO Art has come a long way since its debut back in 2020. What started as a mindfulness exercise in carefully placing dot tiles or studs in pop art mosaics has expanded to a variety of pas relief from Comic Books to Renaissance masterpieces and Japanese woodcuts to modern sculpture. With the release of 31215, we see an ongoing evolution of the theme. How does this model stack up compared to LEGO Art sets that I have put together in the past? In this review, we will take a look at some of the building techniques used, how the set adopts several tricks and techniques used by Vincent van Gogh. Along the way, we will take a look at his fascination with sunflowers, and some of the highlights of the build for me.</p>
                <p>The box is a standard 18+ set black, with a large, oblique image of the final model on the front, along with the Van Gogh Museum's "sunflowers" logo. We are reminded that the build comes with an accompanying podcast, featuring the designer, Stijn Oom, as well as some of the team from the Van Gogh Museum. The back of the box shows the original painting (well, the Van Gogh museum's replicant of the 4th variation of sunflowers in a vase) next to the build, as well as the obligatory lifestyle photo and a closeup of the build itself. The box also reveals the new visual identity for LEGO Art. Previously, there has been no specific identity or branding for LEGO Art on the box, and the website once features the Word Art filled in with grey dots. This year, the word art has shifted to a lower case form, with a frame added next to the wording.</p>
                <p>As the sets are aimed at an 18+ audience, the obligatory ICONs style greeble strip has been added (metallic gold in this set). On closer examination, the strip features elements such as the minifigure palette and paint brush. As we open up, there are a total of 34 numbered bags, and around 5 bags containing a mixture of light bluish grey 16x16,(12) and 6x16 plates (3) along with a couple of flex tubes. The Knoller in chief has not laid those elements out as we go along, but she has laid out the rest of the 2498 pieces included in the set.</p>
                <p>Lots of painters paint flowers. Vincent van Gogh was no different. After years of trialling different types of flowers: experimenting with their form and colours, he resolved to create works based on the Sun Flower. The flower takes on so many forms, from bud, through to blooming, withering and going to seed, and Vincent van Gogh enjoyed painting them all. He initially painted a series in Paris, while he was staying with his brother Theo (1886-1888). These sunflowers were lying on a surface, not in a vase. However, when he moved to Arles, in the south, he painted a new series: Van Gogh created 4 paintings of Sunflowers while in Arles. He also made several copies, or repetitions of his original paintings to present as gifts. The LEGO designer set out to make this set as close as possible to repetition of the fourth version, which is held in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam. With this fourth version, van Gogh had set out to create the image in three shades of yellow.</p>
                <p>Van Gogh painted his sunflowers in a vase using an impasto technique. The paint was thickly layered onto the canvas, on top of the previous layers, resulting in the final image demonstrating a little texture. We see this in the build here where we have raised studs on the back ground, and as we build up individual layers. Withered and aging sunflowers are particularly good examples of how the impasto technique translates from paint to LEGO. I appreciate how the animal horn elements, in olive green and dark green, represent some of these failing and damaged blooms. Bright green horns are also used, perhaps representing aspects of fresher flowers.</p>
                <p>While some of these aging plants are the more interesting layered builds - playing on shades of green, bright yellow and the occasional flat gold element, the thriving blooms are a little different. These are predominantly flat gold, with a golden or nougat centre (this sounds like they belong in a chocolate box…but I digress) These flowers are built around a steering wheel core, with groups of elements attached to clips forming the petals. This colour feels odd, initially, but when you compare it with the original artwork, it doesn't feel as out of place. There is sufficient variety in the shape of the petals that they are not as frustratingly repetitive to build as they might initially appear. the with combinations of gold or tan 1x2 plates with clips, occasionally with added plates for thickness, or a 1x1 plate, plate with clip or roller skate. The addition of the lime green and dark tan elements is consistent with the source material.</p>
                <p>The Frame drops around the canvas fairly easily, and is then secured by Technic axles with a stopper on the end. The axles pass through normal Technic brick holes in the frame, and are secured in bricks with a cross hole for the axle. The axles protrude past the border of the canvas, so they can be easily accessed for removal. The frame, structurally, consists of a layer of plates, topped by two layers of bricks, with another two plates on top of that. The frame is topped off with a layer of tan plates around the edge. This takes us up to the end of Bag 6.</p>
                <p>On first glance, the build looks very LEGO, but when placed side by side with the original, I am more and more impressed with the way in which the details have been captured, using elements that capture the flow of the lines - be they curved tiles, coloured bull horns or diamonds. The choice on leaving visible studs in different locations also enhances the impasto technique used to layer up the original image. I am impressed at how many of the small details in the original make it over into the LEGO model.</p>
                <p>In this latest LEGO Art set, the line really comes of age. Here is a build that, from a distance, looks a lot like the original. It is not a case of pixel art, but an evolution to a point that we see the mixture of plate and tile flow together to remind us of the original brush strokes in the image. The build is not complicated, but there are some areas that require added concentration. The "canvas" background is put together in such a way that it is hard to make a mistake that will cost you more than 10-15 minutes. The flowers use a variety of techniques, and the way that wedge plates, tiles and horns work together to bring us the individual brush strokes of one level, and then layer up to provide the texture of the model in the same way that van Gogh's impasto technique did on the original.</p>
                <p>Overall construction was fairly straight forward, although the initial steps with constructing the canvas did leave me concerned the final build might be a little unstable. These concerns were gone when a model balancing on one edge got caught by an errant breeze, and fell onto the floral side. A few flowers needed to be reattached, but the canvas and frame were relatively unscathed. If I have any concerns about the final design, it might be with the way that petals and leave on the upper right "withering" flower tend to point upwards, rather than across or down. Overall, I could probably deal with this pretty simply, rather than complain about it here. The frame itself is sturdy, and the hanging element works well to support the model hanging on the wall. Interestingly, while the original 48 stud square mosaics in the first wave used 2 hanging bricks, this uses only one. It does make it easier to hang the finished product straight on the wall.</p>
