                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>Now that 21333 Vincent Van Gogh: The Starry Night has officially been revealed, I’m honored to be able to share my full review of this remarkable set! The #41 LEGO Ideas set is a LEGO Art set on steroids, and true to the LEGO Ideas theme, introduces a model so unique, and bold that you would never expect something like this to work as a LEGO set. 21333 Vincent Van Gogh: The Starry Night had a release date of 1 June 2022, however, LEGO VIP members got exclusive early access on 25 May 2022 priced at $169.99.</p>
                <p>Here’s a look at the instruction manual for the set. Interestingly, the set is a collaboration with New York City’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), one of the most distinguished modern art museums in the world, and also the permanent home of Starry Night. The manual has plenty of educational information about Vincent van Gogh, who was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter and his masterpiece, The Starry Night. The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting, and is widely regarded as Van Gogh’s magnum opus, in addition to being most recognized paintings in Western art. It’s always a great sign when you unbox a LEGO set to discover that there is no sticker sheet within. The Starry Night boasts all these gorgeous, printed elements, which really elevate and bring the model to life, and in my opinion is a fantastic move by LEGO.</p>
                <p>The build was very involved for a 2,316-piece set, with plenty of intricate details being constructed out of a very basic selection of elements. You start with the base, assembling the trees and town in the painting - if you enjoy micro builds, you’ll have fun here, although the there’s quite a bit of repetition, especially for the waves. The color palette and element selection really stands out, and you get to play with so many “rare colors”, many of which are new variants. One of the highlights of the build was in Bag 5, where you build the backdrop of The Starry Night. It was quite relaxing, and I really enjoyed it, even if it did take me a while.</p>
                <p>Just like The Starry Night, the finished model is an absolutely jaw-dropping thing of beauty. The design team have done a remarkable job adapting fan designer Truman Cheng’s vision and concept and amped it up to a whole new level. The set takes one of the most famous and iconic pieces of art that isn’t the Mona Lisa and transforms it into a 3D painting that “pops out” of the frame - it’s a really cool effect and works so well here. The colors, also reach out and grab you, and I love what the designers have done here, blending Bright Light Yellows, Light Aqua, Dark Azure, Medium Blue, Bright Light Blue and so much more. Never have I built a set with such a great aesthetic, and so many wonderful colors.</p>
                <p>Van Gogh comes with a new blue paintbrush, as well as a new paint palette which features some of the primary colors used in the set, which is a really nice touch. And yes, he also comes with a minifigure-scale version of Starry Night, which has been translated into a more cartoony, visual on his canvas, which sits on an easel. It’s printed, and a gorgeous little accompaniment to the Van Gogh minifigure. There’s a cute little stand that can be swiveled, allowing you to place Van Gogh, as if he were painting and drawing inspiration from the large LEGO artwork in front of him.</p>
                <p>The textures, and depth created by the 3D-effect really work well here, and I love the intricate layering work here. It really boosts the composition of the entire set, and because there’s just so much going on, it really draws you in as you’ll notice cool little things here and there. I love the little houses, and waves in the background. As your eyes move upwards into the sky, you’ll get drawn in by the large expressionistic swirls, especially the big one in the middle that dominates the canvas.

                <p>What LEGO has done that instantly elevates and improves on the original Ideas submission is the introduction of these printed dish elements. The graphic design is top-notch, and this really ties the entire model together, and give it that otherworldly look that you expect when you visualize The Starry Night in your head. These printed elements are probably one of my favorite things about the build, and I cannot tell you how happy I am that these are printed.</p>
                <p>I hope the photos I took does 21333 Vincent Van Gogh: The Starry Night justice because this is one of those classic sets where a picture really does tell a thousand words. LEGO have done an incredibly satisfying job at taking one of the most recognized and renowned works of art, and masterfully translated it into LEGO, giving it its own spin with the pop-out 3D-effect. There’s just so much to love about this set, and just like Van Gogh’s masterpiece, it has an otherworldly, almost ethereal aura about it, which is crazy when you realize it’s made out of thousands of blocky plastic bits. The 3D-effect works really well here, drawing your eye in to all the tiny little details, shapes and textures, in a way that is only made possible with LEGO.</P>
                <p>If there’s one small oddity, is whether this should sit within the LEGO Ideas theme, and not LEGO’s already established Art theme. I don’t know the answer to this, but after building it, it does feel more Ideas than Art, although I acknowledge this is a very valid question. There’s nothing I actively dislike about this model, and I think it’s a really superb set that has no equal. The choice of creating all these lovely, printed dishes are inspired and really elevate this set beyond what it already is. I would highly recommend this set, especially if you enjoy the world of art, and history, and Van Gogh’s post-expressionist works. This is a sublime set that really pushes the envelope when it comes to what you think is possible with LEGO.</p>
