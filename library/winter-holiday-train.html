                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Several Christmas-themed LEGO® trains, both big and small, have appeared over the years and this coming holiday season brings us 40700 Winter Holiday Train, a Gift with Purchase (GwP) available to LEGO® Insiders from midnight 29 November to 2 December 2024. The set has 294 parts and no stickers. There are no recolours and no new moulds in this set, but it is a cute build. There are two instructions booklets; one for the engine and a second for the two carriages hauling gifts.</p>
                <p>While there are no new elements, there are a couple of rarer elements in the set. Additionally, there are three particular elements that are supplied in a nice quantity for such a small set. The steam engine is built first. There's some offsetting of pieces to centralise the boiler, which is mainly built studs-up. The smokebox at the front is a little clunky, made using 2 x 2 x 2/3 curved slope (15068) and the 2 x 1 curved slope with notches (29120 and 29119) on the sides.</p>
                <p>My favourite part of the engine itself is the red cowcatcher on the front. It's built using Bar 2L with Stop (78258) and 2 x 2 Trapezoid flags (80324) and looks great on the engine. This train is ready for any snow drifts on the track. While this cloud piece has appeared in 25 sets already as chimney smoke, engine exhaust fumes or clouds, amazingly this is the first time it has been used as the steam coming from a steam engine. It looks like it was perfectly designed for this set. The two carriages are both built in a similar manner with 1x4x1 lattice fences in pearl gold (4536675 | 3633) encircling stacks of gifts. The larger of the two also has space for a tree made by stacking three of the round 2 x 2 x 2/3 bricks with 4 leafs in dark green (6426730 | 15469) and the rather rare 2 x 2 truncated cone, which is topped off with a star, naturally.</p>
                <p>The completed model is aesthetically pleasing; indeed rather cute. For a GwP it has a good quantity of elements, including a couple of rarer ones thrown in. While there is nothing exclusive, it is a timely freebie with Christmas approaching and can be enjoyed by younger builders too. It's also nice that purchases from any theme will get you to the threshold. $170 may seem like a lot, but with so many costly sets available it might be easy to achieve, and of course there are Double Insiders Points to accumulate too.</p>
