                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>10340 Wreath is the second such seasonal decoration LEGO has created, following 40426 Christmas Wreath 2-in-1 which, if I remember correctly, sold out at LEGO.com within days of its release in 2020. Unlike that earlier one, this year's has been categorised as part of the 18+ botanical collection, perhaps to capitalise on the popularity of that series. It's evident from the picture on the box that the set is packed with botanical elements, many appearing in new colours for the first time, including 74 dark green and 16 sand green small palm leaves, and 20 olive green and 12 dark green of the newer Leaf 2 x 6 x 1 with 2 Studs.</p>
                <p>Construction begins with an octagonal ring onto which the leaves and other decorations will be attached onto the myriad clips and bars. Four identical sections are built and then clipped together to make a circle, or in a line to make a garland. There's a lot of repetition involved, which may test your patience somewhat. Four wall mount hooks are mounted on the underside to enable it to be hung from a door or wall. Adding the leaves and other bits and pieces is also slightly tedious, especially if you want to make sure they are positioned and angled exactly as shown in the instructions, which is, of course, not entirely necessary.</p>
                <p>Everything you'd expect to find on a wreath is present and correct, including pine cones that make good use of dark brown minifig flat caps, dried orange slices that incorporate a printed transparent orange 6x6 dish, twigs of conifer, cinnamon sticks, and berries. Red holly berries are traditionally used in the UK, but if you prefer, you can swap them out for another variety using the alternative ball joints and flowers provided. It's well worth enduring the slightly arduous building experience, though, because the end result is magnificent and very realistic. It's about 38cm in diameter, much bigger than the 2020 version, and on a par with one you might make from more traditional materials.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, it's not possible to unclip and disconnect the four sections of the ring to reconfigure them to the garland without stripping off much of the foliage. Needless to say, I didn't fancy doing that just for this review! However you plan to display it, it'll look lovely in your home over Christmas and, unlike real wreaths, it'll last for years. That is, unless you dismantle it to make use of the wonderful collection of plant pieces in your own models!</p>
