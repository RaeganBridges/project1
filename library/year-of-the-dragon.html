                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>From large majestic models like 80112 Auspicious Dragon, to smaller Creator builds like 31145 Red Dragon, or Ninjago dragons 71809 Egalt the Master Dragon, and also GWPs (gift with purchase) like 40611 Year of the Dragon. This is the 10th edition of LEGO's Chinese Zodiac animal models, which first began with 40148 Year of the Sheep in 2015. LEGO have then released a new one each year corresponding to the Chinese Zodiac Animal. There are 12 Zodiac Animals in total, so we're just two away from completing the entire collection - a 12-year long pursuit!</p>
                <p>Included in each LEGO Chinese Zodiac is a hongbao (red envelope) featuring the year and photo of the Chinese Zodiac animal. In Chinese tradition, red envelopes are handed out during the Lunar New Year as emblems of good fortune and luck, and contain money! For a 214-piece set, the build is an enjoyable one for fans of creature-building. Like the other LEGO Chinese Zodiac animals, these look quite cartoony, but the dragon does benefit from being a powerful mythical creature and the designer has employed a fun palette of colours. A really fun build technique is the use of two trumpets for the horns! The base is also quite well-designed and unique compared to the other Chinese zodiac animals that have been released. The base depicts the dragon floating and being seated among the clouds.</p>
                <p>Now that the LEGO Year of the Dragon set has been released, this brings us up to 10 Zodiac animals so far! This has been a 10-year endeavour to collect and I'm actually so excited that we're so close to completing the 12-year cycle. When the Year of the Sheep first came out in 2015, I distinctively remembered thinking that it would be such a long wait it would be to collect all the Zodiac Animals, but now that we're at the 10th, we only have the Snake (2025) and Horse (2026) remaining, although I do think the cycle will officially end in 2027 as they remake Year of the Sheep given it's not the same design format as the others.</p>
                <p>Dragons are typically revered amongst all the Chinese Zodiac animals for their mystical properties, and LEGO have done a great job with the Year of the Dragon. It benefits from not being based on a common farm animal or critter which allows LEGO to reimagine a cute Oriental design and have a little fun with the colours and shape. Looking at it amongst all the other Zodiac animals released, it definitely stand outs in all the best ways and those lucky enough to have qualified for the Year of the Dragon GWP during the promotional period will be very happy with this design.</p>
