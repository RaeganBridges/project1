                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>There were two small sets released at the start of the 2021 year that are available only at LEGO Brand Stores. The first of these is 40468 Yellow Taxi, which at the very least provides a good supply of the titular yellow bricks. Inside the box are two unnumbered bags, and instruction booklet, a 2x14 plate, and a small sticker sheet. The sticker sheet is a little disappointing for a small build, but they do add key details to the cab, such as the signs that say “Taxi”. Read on to see if it stops traffic, or if it’s something to pass by.</p>
                <p>It’s clear from the stickers that this is a cab that hails from New York City, thanks to the ads on the top. One side is an advertisement for (likely New York style) pizza, while the other looks to be promoting a visit to Lady Liberty. The front of the cab looks a little boxy to me, though I recognize it’s made out of bricks, after all. I do like the sloped piece included for the car’s hood (or bonnet). And clearly, I didn’t straighten out the mirror pieces before taking pictures, though one could argue that’s New York realism. The back of the cab looks similarly boxy. I’ve been puzzling what the license plate letters/numbers are referencing - nothing leaps to mind, though perhaps it’s the designer’s initials.</p>
                <p>When I first saw that there was a taxi set coming, I was hoping it would accommodate passengers. It doesn’t, which is too bad, though I’m sure that design that did so would surely drive up the price point. For kids looking to have a car to build and play around with, I think this is perfect. There are a couple of harder to find pieces in this set, including the transparent 1x2 roof tile, so there may be some appeal as a parts pack.</p>
