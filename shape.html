        <h3>Corona</h3>
            <p>This classic cigar size measures around 5.5 inches in length with a ring gauge of 42 to 44. It's a great choice for beginners as it has a balanced flavor and moderate strength. The history of the corona cigar size dates back to the 19th century, when cigars first became popular in Europe and North America. The corona size is believed to have originated in Cuba, where it quickly became a popular choice among cigar smokers. <i>Cohiba Black Corona</i> is a premium cigar out of Dominican Republic with rich and spicy medium-to-full bodied blend <b>($19 MSRP)</b>.</p>

        <h3>Lancero</h3>
            <p>Theseis slim cigars vitola measures around 7.5 inches in length with a ring gauge of 38 to 40. Lanceros are known for their complex and concentrated flavor profiles, often featuring notes of wood, coffee, leather, and spice. Due to the small ring gauge, the flavor of the tobacco is amplified, providing a unique smoking experience that is favored by many connoisseurs.The lancero vitola can be challenging to roll, which is why it is typically only made by experienced cigar rollers. The thinness of the cigar wrapper can make it difficult to achieve a consistent draw, so the construction of the lancero requires a high level of skill. This is also, my all time favorite vitola with so many blends to choose from. <i>Villa Casdagli Lancero</i> is sitting at a top of my list with very complex notes of coffee, caramel, spice and vanilla. If you can find it, grab a box. <b>($17 MSRP)</b>.</p>
